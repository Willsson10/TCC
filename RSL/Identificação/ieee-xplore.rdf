        <dc:title>An Online Retail Prediction Model Based on AGA-LSTM Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of e-commerce, the scale of online retail is becoming larger and larger. The prediction of sales volume is facing the challenges of various categories and changeable customer demands. Based on this, this paper proposes an online retail prediction model based on AGA-LSTM neural network. In the process of building LSTM neural network, the adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is used to optimize the network parameters such as time step, hidden layer number and training times to improve the prediction accuracy of the model, and it is used to forecast the types of goods and the total sales volume. The results on the Online Retail II dataset in UCI show that the prediction accuracy of AGA-LSTM model is greatly enhanced compared with the traditional LSTM model, which verifies the effectiveness of this algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Sales Forecasting in E-Commerce Through Advanced Predictive Analytics and Deep Neural Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Within this context, this research is aimed at enhancing the sales forecasting in e-commerce using the newer approaches of predictive analytics and deep neural networks. There usually is significant variability of results as compared to traditional approaches that are based on historical data and simple econometric models. This research evaluates how deep learning approaches, LSTM and Transformer models, improve precisely the forecast by noticing the behaviour dynamics and more complex patterns in the business environment. The actual approach includes sales history data, understanding customers, trends, and related promotions to train as well as test neural networks. The basic hybrid approach integrates deep learning and statistical methods to forecast the maximum potential outcomes. The performance of models in this study is evaluated by Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) and R-Squared to compare the forecasted sales values with the actual ones. It is established that incorporating the deep learning models that have been described enhances the forecast precision concerning the baseline and conventional methods of approach significantly, especially the hybrid model. The precise accuracy, and factors that cause it to fluctuate from one product category to another, and the impact of promotional activities on the forecast's precision, are addressed. Thus, the study contributes to the knowledge that adopting innovative techniques such as advanced predictive analytics and deep learning to improve sales forecasting can potentiate strategic business courses of action and the firm's performance in today's cut-throat e-commerce marketplace.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI-Driven E-Commerce Pricing: Sentiment Analysis, Deep Learning &amp; Reinforcement Learning Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in e-commerce has revolutionized pricing strategies by enabling dynamic adjustments based on customer sentiment and market trends. Traditional pricing models, reliant on fixed rules, often fail to account for consumer sentiment, leading to inefficiencies. This study proposes an AI-powered dynamic pricing framework that combines sentiment analysis with deep learning (LSTM, ANN) and reinforcement learning (PPO) to optimize pricing strategies dynamically. Customer sentiment, extracted from product ratings, is integrated into pricing decisions. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ensures adaptive and stable price modifications, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predicts future price fluctuations using historical data. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) fine-tunes prices in real-time, learning from market responses to maximize revenue. Experimental results demonstrate that AI-based pricing significantly influences price distributions, with ANN providing balanced adjustments, LSTM excelling in demand forecasting, and PPO offering dynamic adaptability for real-time optimization. Additionally, the study introduces an AI-powered marketing strategy recommendation system to align promotional efforts with sentiment trends, enhancing consumer engagement and profitability. The findings underscore the importance of sentiment-aware AI pricing models in modern e-commerce, offering a scalable and robust framework for revenue generation and market competitiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing the Forecasting Performance with the Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques for Online Shopping Channels: A Case Study of Electronic Products in Thailand</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study proposes novel hybrid forecasting models, which are the combination between Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and traditional models. The objective is to investigate the trend of customer behavior on electronic products and reduce the demand variation that will be impact the total cost in the supply chain. In order to prove the performance of our proposed hybrid models, a Thai company case study is tested with four online shopping electronic products. Accuracy and demand variation are used to compare the effectiveness of our hybrid forecasting model. For the accuracy, some performance indicator tools, such as MAE, RMSE, and MASE, show that the hybrid models provide the lowest error among these indicators with three products, while the single LSTM provide the lowest error with only one product. For the demand variation, all forecasted demand provide the coefficient variation (CV) score less than 0.25, which mean that all products are less variation, and can be used to calculate the forecast stock levels in the company.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Online Product Sales Prediction Based on Elman Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The prediction of online product sales affects the decision-making process of enterprise online sales. The academic community has conducted numerous studies on product sales prediction, and the vast majority of existing literature uses feedforward neural networks for sales prediction. As sales belong to time series data, recurrent neural networks with memory function may be more suitable for online product sales prediction. Therefore, this paper constructs the Elman neural network model as a representative of recurrent neural networks, and constructs the BP (Back Propagation) neural network model as a representative of feedforward neural networks. By using the same data to train and test the Elman neural network and the BP neural network, the error between the two network networks is compared and analyzed. The results show that the Elman neural network's prediction of online product sales is closer to the actual value. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the BP neural network are 8.03 times, 8.12 times and 8.24 times of the corresponding values of the Elman neural network, respectively. The error value of the BP neural network is much larger than that of the Elman neural network, and the Elman neural network has more stable and less fluctuating prediction. Therefore, compared with the BP neural network, the Elman neural network has higher prediction accuracy, more stable prediction, better prediction effect and more accurate prediction of online product sales.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predictive Analytics for Inventory Management in E-commerce Using Machine Learning Algorithms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A description of the abstract for the research paper titled “Predictive Analytics for Inventory Management in E-commerce Using Machine Learning Algorithms” is as follows: In this research, a novel strategy for implementing force operations in e-commerce is presented. This strategy involves the utilization of predictive analytics and machine literacy algorithms. When it comes to the ever-changing landscape of online retail, efficient force operation is necessary to satisfy customer demand while simultaneously minimizing the costs that are connected with overstocking and stockouts. To predict future demand for specific products, prophetic analytics methods are utilized, which involve the utilization of literal deal data in addition to other relevant elements. To create accurate prophetic models that are capable of locating complicated patterns and trends in the data, machine literacy methods such as arbitrary timbers, support vector machines, and neural networks are utilized. Through the incorporation of these prophetic models into the process of force operation, ecommerce businesses canoptimize force circumstances, expedite operations, and improve customer happiness. In addition to making a contribution to the expanding body of literature on data-driven approaches to force operation, this investigation demonstrates the potential for predictive analytics and machine literacy to be utilized in the process of tackling the specific issues that are associated with ecommerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on E-commerce Mathematical Forecasting Model based on Hybrid Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a sales forecasting model of e-commerce products based on hybrid neural network. Firstly, we screen the factors that have great influence on sales volume to establish the sales volume prediction index system, and then the fusion value of each level index in the sales volume prediction index system is obtained by combining entropy weighting and hierarchical analysis methods as the three inputs of the sales volume prediction model. Then, a hybrid neural network model based on voting-ensemble method is established, and the performance of the model is evaluated. The experimental results show that the ensemble model has higher accuracy in the sales forecast of e-commerce. At the same time, the model in this paper is also practical, which can promote B2C e-commerce enterprises to optimize inventory management, improve the overall efficiency of logistics, and then improve the overall customer satisfaction and improve the competitiveness of enterprises.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Forecasting of E-Commerce System for Sale Prediction Using Deep Learning Modified Neural Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling goods over the Internet. Customers will appreciate the simplicity of not having to make physical purchases using e-primary commerce. They will order the item online and deliver it to their home as soon as feasible. This research aimed to create deep learning algorithms capable of forecasting e-commerce sales. This project aims to develop and test a model for predicting online product sales over a wide range of online product types. It bases its decisions on the requirements for online product sales, the factors influencing online product sales in various industries, and the benefits of the deep learning algorithm. A continuous Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) method for optimizing the parameters of a deep learning-modified neural network (DLMNN) is introduced in this paper. In e-commerce demand forecasting studies, a time series dataset is also analyzed. The DLMNN model’s performance improvements across multiple product categories are illustrated using a non-deep learning model as a baseline comparison. The experiment also shows that the unsupervised pretrained DLMNN model outperforms the competition in terms of sales predictions. For root mean square error, the proposed technique obtained RMSE, Mean, and Standard Deviation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Hybrid Demand Forecasting for Intermittent Demand Patterns using Machine Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Intermittent demand forecasting is a major obstacle to the digital supply chain revolution and accurate demand forecasting (DF) enhances the overall productivity of enterprises and minimizes expenditures. Random and low-volume demand is referred to as intermittent demand. It appears erratically between demand periods, with a high percentage of zero values. Companies managing complex inventory systems face difficulties due to intermittent demand's unexpected nature, which results in expenses associated with excess inventory or stockouts. This research aims to present an integrated forecasting strategy for intermittent demand problems using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and parametric methods to assist new range of management decisions as a vital element of intelligent supply chain. This can be achieved by two biggest e- commerce companies' dataset and the results showed that hybrid forecasting framework results are more accurately than traditional forecasting techniques. The hybrid Intermittent forecasting can be used as an alternate technique for anticipating intermittent demand since its ease of computing of forecasting results accurately than the classical forecasting methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Supply Chain Optimization: Machine Learning Applications in Inventory Management for E-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study looks at how machine learning (ML) methods can be used in e-commerce inventory management to make demand forecasting and inventory optimisation more accurate and efficient. The literature review shows how important it is for online stores to keep track of their goods well and how machine learning algorithms might be able to help with this problem. Several machine learning techniques are talked about, such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning, along with how they can be used in inventory management. The study makes up the suggested architecture for ML-based inventory management: importing data, preparing data, finding features, storing data, and the ML system. Real-world examples, like how Amazon uses AI in its forecasting, show that ML can be used in e-commerce product management and show its benefits. Real-world examples show that decision tree models and deep learning methods like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are useful for predicting demand and optimising supplies. But problems are pointed out, such as bad data, a lack of computing power, and models that are hard to understand. In the future, researchers will look into how to fix problems with machine learning algorithms, how to use new technologies like bitcoin and augmented reality, and how to make sure that AI is used in an ethical way and that customer data is kept safe. The study finds that machine learning has a lot of potential to change how e-commerce inventory is managed, which could lead to more efficiency and better decisions in the digital market.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Hybrid Approach for Time Series Forecasting Using Temporal Convolution Networks and CatBoost Classifier</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In retail, demand forecasting is crucial for managing inventory, enhancing efficiency, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex data patterns, prompting the development of a hybrid model that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Cat Boost for improved accuracy. Tested on a large dataset of 540,000 demand entries, the model achieved a significant reduction in prediction errors (MSE) by over 96%, enabling retailers to make better decisions regarding stock management, supply chain operations, and customer satisfaction. This approach not only optimizes inventory but also minimizes overstocking and shortages, resulting in enhanced operational efficiency. Such innovative solutions are pivotal for the dynamic and data-driven retail industry.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on the Construction of User Portrait of Cross-border E-commerce Platform Based on Artificial Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the vigorous development of global trade, the scale of cross-border e-commerce platform users is increasing, and the user needs and behavior characteristics are becoming more complex and diverse. Accurately constructing user portraits is of great significance for improving platform marketing effect, optimizing product recommendation and enhancing user experience. However, the traditional e-commerce user portrait construction method relies on statistical analysis, rule matching and other means, and there are many limitations in dealing with large-scale, high-dimensional and nonlinear user data. In this regard, this paper will explore the application feasibility of artificial neural network in this respect according to the actual application requirements, and propose a brand-new user portrait construction framework for cross-border e-commerce platforms, so as to achieve more accurate and efficient user portrait construction. Practice has proved that this framework is based on BP neural network and combined with gradient lifting decision tree (GBDT). Through comparative analysis, it is proved that this framework has practical advantages in user portrait prediction in the face of high-dimensional sparse features. At the same time, the horizontal comparative analysis experiment also shows the feasibility and practicability of BP neural network in constructing user portraits.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Quotidian Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Retailers have been experiencing a drop in their sales due to the rise of E-commerce facilities. This poses a problem where the retail stores need to efficiently manage and price their products to increase their sales. Hence the need for efficient sales prediction and dynamic pricing arises. A forecasting model which can effectively predict the sales of a retail store will help retailers compete in the market. With this intent, the paper proposes a model based on XGBoost whose learners are fitted to the store- product subsets with optimum parameters to increase the overall performance of sales prediction. The proposed model predicted sales for 10 stores with 50 products, with average MAPE, RMSE and R2 values of 11.98 %, 6.63 and 0.76 respectively. In addition, dynamic pricing is applied to the forecasted results which specifies the optimum price of a product based on its demand.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sales Forecasting in Cross Border E-Commerce using Convolutional Neural Network-Gated Recurrent Unit</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Cross-border e-commerce has expanded quickly, precise sales forecasts are essential to maximizing marketing, logistics, and inventory control. Because commerce generates so much deal data every second, predictive analysis has never been more important for logistics management. To improve supply control and customer service, e-commerce companies are increasingly using AI technologies to improve forecasts. To improve the accuracy of sales forecasting, this study suggests a Convolutional Neural Network-Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU) hybrid model. Where GRU records temporal dependencies and sequential patterns, CNN derives spatial dependencies from sales data. The model performs better, since it is trained using historical sales data, product features, and market trends from Amazon and Flipkart data. In the end, the suggested method optimizes business operations in cross-border e-commerce by improving demand forecasting and lowering instances of stockouts and overstock. With an accuracy score of 98.61%, precision score of 98.22%, recall score of 98.12%, and F1 score of 98.13%, the experimental results indicate that this implementation-based approach performs better. Enhancing system adaptability and using control-based techniques for increased sales prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting E-commerce Sales Forecasting and Inventory Management Based on Fuzzy LIM-CNN Technique</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online shopping's share of the market has grown over the last decade, even if retail as a whole has slowed. Logistical costs for EC are higher than for other retail models due to a variety of problems with inventory management. Even though EC makes inventory management more difficult, it works well with EC because consumers can easily compare prices, which is important because goods demand is very price sensitive. Three stages, including preprocessing, feature selection, and model training, make up this suggested approach. The term &quot;data preprocessing&quot; refers to the steps used to remove any anomalies or noise from the chosen data. Using feature selection, we may sift through different datasets and extract the most unnecessary and superfluous information. A Fuzzy LIM-CNN was employed for the purpose of training the model. The proposed approach outperforms CNN and Fuzzy LIM with an average accuracy of 91.67%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on emergency parcel mobilization in e-commerce logistics network based on BP neural network and Bayesian network prediction model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Logistics sites consist of receiving warehouses, sorting centers, business offices, etc. The e-commerce logistics network consists of logistics sites and transport routes connecting logistics sites. The volume of goods will be affected by the fluctuating situation of orders placed on holidays, force majeure disasters and other emergencies, which will lead to the shutdown of logistics venues or temporary inability to deliver goods, which will then need to be transmitted to other venues. Predicting the number of parcels in each logistics site and line can improve the operational efficiency and design an effective logistics network, which is of great significance for guaranteeing the normal transportation of the logistics network. The prediction model of the time series of the cargo volume of the line based on BP neural network is established. This paper visualizes the data of the daily cargo volume of each line during the period from 2023-01-01 to 2023-01-31, predict the data by using BP neural network, and output the prediction results for 31 days, taking the three lines DC14→DC10, DC20→DC35, DC25→DC62 as examples, and give the training diagram, training state, regression diagram, and the line simulation and prediction Results. The Bayesian network model is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which consists of nodes representing variables and directed edges connecting these nodes. The nodes represent random variables and the directed edges between the nodes represent the interrelationships between the nodes, with conditional probabilities indicating the strength of the relationship between the variables. The absence of a parent node is represented as an input to that node using a priori probabilities. Multiple regression analysis was performed to test the correlation between the independent and dependent variables, using the volume of shipments as the dependent variable, and site 1 (sending courier) and site 2 (receiving courier) as the dependent variables. The average of all shipment volumes for each route for the years 2021 and 2022 was averaged as a proxy for the average shipment volume for each route. Multiple regression is performed. Finally robustness is tested.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI Based Retail Sales Management: Leveraging Optimized Metaheuristic Algorithms for Forecasting and Recommendations</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Today, the retail sales forecasting has an important component in the companies of E-commerce. The retail sales forecasting improves the performance of business decision, product sales, storage management. The retail sales forecasting is a challenging task, that involves major business dynamics as well as not to solved by the dynamic approaches. In this study, an improved Recurrent Neural network (RNN) is proposed for the accurate sales forecasting related to E-commerce companies. This proposed method utilized the two benchmark datasets such as Rossmann and Walmart and linear interpolating method is used to filling the missing values in this dataset. The proposed method utilized the hyperparameter tuning of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to solve the problem of optimization. The model is a statistical measure, the results are evaluated using various parameters such as R Squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Normalized Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) and Normalized Deviation (ND) for measuring the performance fitness. The achieved results are higher to the conventional regression models in retail sales forecasting. The proposed improved RNN achieved the higher R2 is 0.99 and 0.98, MAE is 0.30 and 0.31, MSE is 0.29 and 0.30, NRMSE is 0.11 and 0.08 as well as ND is 0.12 and 0.05 on Rossmann and Walmart dataset respectively. In future, the proposed method is improved by reducing the overfitting method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on E-Commerce Product Demand Forecasting Method Based on ARIMA-SVR-PSO</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of e-commerce, accurate forecasting of product demand is crucial for optimizing inventory management and enhancing customer satisfaction. This paper presents an e-commerce product demand forecasting method based on ARIMA-SVR-PSO. The method begins with data preprocessing and statistical analysis to construct datasets that include historical shipment volumes, product information, merchant information, and warehouse information. It then utilizes intermittent demand time series forecasting techniques, such as exponential smoothing and the Croston method, for preliminary demand predictions. Furthermore, this paper combines the autoregression, differencing, and moving average components of the ARIMA model, along with the application of the SVR model in regression forecasting, optimizing model parameters through the PSO algorithm to minimize forecast errors and improve accuracy. Experimental results show that compared to traditional ARIMA and SVR models, the proposed optimized model has significantly improved prediction accuracy, reflected in lower RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, as well as a higher coefficient of determination (\mathbfR^\mathbf2). Additionally, through visual analysis, this paper explores the seasonality and intermittency of product demand, as well as potential correlations between different products.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-Commerce Purchase Prediction Based on Graph Neural Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This With the booming development of the Internet, many online trading platforms have emerged, and e-commerce shopping is gradually becoming an important way of consumption for people. While e-commerce brings convenience, it also brings the problem of information overload. Ineffectively selecting products at sea wastes time and reduces the efficiency of product distribution. Therefore, product recommendation has become an important way to alleviate the information overload of e-commerce shopping. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a multi-label prediction task and propose a new graph neural network-based framework, the item-relational graph neural network (IRGNN), for the simultaneous discovery of multiple complex relationships. The feature vectors of nodes are encoded and learned based on known network structures, and the learned node features are decoded to explore the statistical patterns of node features and link formation between nodes, and to analyse which features are prone to form links between nodes that possess them. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world product data to verify the effectiveness of IRGNN, particularly on large and sparse product graphs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Courier Demand Forecasting Problem Based on BP Neural Network Modeling</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the popularization of online shopping, the demand for express delivery services is rising, stimulating the further development of our economy. Therefore, how to compress the cost of express delivery and plan reasonable transportation routes and storage sites is very important. First of all, the data are quantitatively imported into MATLAB, determine the input parameters as the date and city, and the output variable as the amount of goods, predict the number of express delivery on each line of 2019.4.18 and 2019.4.19, and sum up the predicted number of express delivery to get the total number of express transportation. Then the data are classified and summarized according to the city pairs, assigning the value of 1 for normal shipment and 0 for no normal shipment, and the data are initially processed and divided, and the BP neural network algorithm is applied to establish the model of predicted line status and the model of predicted transportation quantity, and the results of predicted line status and the number of express transportation are predicted. Finally, construct the adjacency matrix about the cost of railroad transportation network, determine the transportation cost between two points that is the weight value, realize the Floyd algorithm, and calculate the minimum transportation cost according to the data of the place of receipt and delivery on the same day.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>accurate prediction of sales data is an important and challenging problem in the retail industry. However, due to the diversity of data types, it is difficult for traditional time series prediction models to generate good prediction results for different types of data. This research develops a cognitive analytic framework to help transform retailers from the reactive environment to automated continuously learning environment utilizing the power of AI technology in predicting future sales with high accuracy. It proposes a multi-stage prediction framework based on the integration of Statistical Forecasting, Machine Learning Forecasting (ML), and Deep Learning Forecasting (DL) algorithms. The results of the statistical forecasting stage are taken as a baseline to the others consecutive two stages. This approach uses different forecast models based on different forecast mechanisms. It takes the error of each model as an input feature to the following model. The research shows that this process of creating forecasts using a proposed multi-stage framework that combines the error of each forecast stage as an input feature to the next stage produces better accuracy than the output of any single stage alone as well as when not using the error. This research work presents an advanced approach for more accurate prediction of the sales’ volume during a defined future period. Accuracy reaches as high as 90% with 82% as an average accuracy. The generalization of the proposed framework outperforms the results in both the category and the product levels of forecasting. This is much preferred in E-commerce platforms where there is a high need to generate product-level operational demand forecasts and when there is no historical data for a long time period to capture the seasonality of a target variable.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Feature Enhancement Based Text Sentiment Classification using Deep Learning Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Text sentiment classification is a significant task in the recent years to understand the opinions and thoughts hidden in the text to enhance more productivity in e-commerce websites and also in the social media. Here we integrate deep learning models to analyze the text sentiments. In this paper, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) method for text sentiment analysis is proposed. The proposed CRNN is a combination of different layers used to extract the features from the text dataset. During training CRNN is able to learn the features set of the text sentiment dataset. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on text sentiments of publically available movie review (MR) dataset. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional deep learning techniques.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Hybrid Machine Learning Method for Product Sales Forecasting in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The term “e-commerce” refers to the practice of buying and selling products using the internet. E-commerce was created so that consumers wouldn't have to leave the comfort of their homes to purchase something. So, they can buy it online and have it delivered to their house in a few days. Online retailing has recently developed in a favorable environment because of the robust backing of national legislation. This year's pandemic has made the e-commerce sector's contribution to the growth of the country's economy more noticeable. The quantity and effectiveness of e-commerce networks and e-commerce businesses are growing under such circumstances. A network must've been able to better match user demands and perform admirably in all areas of collaboration and administration if it hopes to keep its competitive edge. Accurately predicting the sales volume of e-commerce networks at this time is crucial. This article presents a novel hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithm to accurately predict revenue growth for an online store. A hybrid cat-XGBoost (HC-XG) algorithm is suggested to predict the sale. The main goal of the proposed work is to forecast e-commerce sales, thus i the final selling value is included in the solution since it has a significant impact on sales in extremely competitive and price-sensitive contexts like e-commerce. We next continue with the development of the suggested solution and evaluate it for accuracy, error, and overall efficiency, and compare it to some competitor solutions. Thus, the proposed approach is compared with other existing models for sales forecasting and demonstrate that it provides the best overall performance in product sales forecasting.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Smartwatch Sales Forecast Based on CNN-LSTM</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Sales forecast is based on the historical sales volume and related factors to predict future sales volume. An accurate sales forecast can provide a scientific theoretical basis for the overall planning of e-commerce enterprises and upgrading e-commerce products. However, with the rapid development of the Internet, there are more and more factors affecting the change of sales volume, and it becomes more and more challenging to forecast the sales volume of e-commerce products. This paper proposes a sales forecasting method based on CNN-LSTM for sales forecast for smartwatches.Firstly, the dimensionality of the feature data of smartwatches is reduced, and then the processed data is put into the model proposed in this paper to predict sales. At the same time, BP neural network model is used for comparative experiments. The results show that the CNN-LSTM sales forecasting method has a better prediction effect, which is of great significance for the overall planning of e-commerce enterprises.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing E-Commerce Innovation with Predictive Analytics in Business Management Using MARL-GNN Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid growth of e-commerce has increased the demand for comprehensive predictive analytics to improve commercial decision-making. Conventional predictive models, such Logistic Regression and Random Forest, fail to accurately represent the complex relationships between consumers and items, hence restricting their accuracy and flexibility. This study introduces MARL-GNN, an innovative framework that integrates Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to represent dynamic customer-product interactions. MARL agents enhance decision-making, whereas GNNs effectively reflect transactional data. The suggested method significantly surpasses current models, with an accuracy of 96.4%, precision of 94.7%, recall of 95.2%, and a reduced MAE of 0.023. In comparison to traditional methods, MARL-GNN effectively adjusts to changing market trends and consumer behaviours, delivering enhanced demand forecasting and business optimisation. The results validate the effectiveness of graph-based reinforcement learning for instantaneous decision-making in e-commerce. Future study may investigate real-time implementation and enhanced explainability to facilitate more industry usage.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Sentiment Insights from Amazon Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent times, the drastic growth of the e-commerce scenario has brought up tremendous volumes of product reviews; most especially for Amazon. While knowing what their customers feel could be important enough for a customer, it is for any business. The study in this paper involves machine and deep learning methods, for performing the task of the sentiment analysis over Amazon review products. We implemented different algorithms, including SVM and Naive Bayes to LSTM networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. It contains a dataset of reviews of various products that are pre-processed for tasks like noise removal and removing irrelevant information. Sentiment labels are assigned based on the review ratings, allowing us to train our models effectively. The evaluation of each model is done using different metrics. Our findings illustrate that the deep learning models significantly surpass traditional methods in accurately predicting sentiment, showing the potential of these techniques in drawing out the insights from user-generated content. This study provides practical implications for e-commerce platforms focusing to leverage customer feedback for improving the product and marketing strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendation algorithm for agricultural and sideline products on e-commerce platforms based on deep learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Aiming at the problem of low accuracy in e-commerce platform recommendation of agricultural and sideline products, an agricultural and sideline product recommendation algorithm based on deep learning was studied. Fully analyze the problems existing in the process of recommending agricultural and sideline products, study the mechanism of item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, and combine the document topic and matrix decomposition hybrid algorithm. Highlighting the advantages of both, a topic weighted fusion collaborative filtering algorithm was formed. Through experiments, this algorithm can effectively improve the recommendation effect of agricultural and sideline products on e-commerce platforms. Compared with the simple item collaborative filtering algorithm, the algorithm studied in this study can effectively improve the accuracy of recommended targets by about 5%, and also has a 2% improvement in the diversity of recommended targets. In terms of accuracy of prediction results, through experimental comparison, the root mean square error of this algorithm is also lower than other comparative algorithms, which proves the advantages of this algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Hybrid Approach for Sentiment Analysis in Online Product Ranking Using CNN and LSTM with Uncertain Lexical Term</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Another important application of sentiment analysis involves identification of consumer attitude toward certain products, and this is particularly important in online product rankings where customers air their opinions in the form of rankings. The usual approach may fail in analysing details of human language and the nature of sentiment itself. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents CNN-LSTM method which incorporate the attributes of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial features and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) for temporal features. CNN extracts local features in text data, while LSTM focuses on the temporal features and the combination of CNN and LSTM make this model ideal in handling sentiment analysis. Further, we present the adaptation of uncertain linguistic term sets to manage uncertainty and vagueness in sentiment expressions. The proposed methodology entails pre-coaching of the CNN-LSTM model on a large dataset of product reviews, and then the performance is compared with standard measures like accuracy, precision and F1-score. The experimental results prove that the proposed hybrid model provides better accuracy as compared to the existing traditional machine learning techniques for sentiment classification and ranking. The above approach improves the performance of the sentiment analysis by a large degree thus giving more accurate data for the e-commerce platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Code of Consumer Minds: Decoding E-Commerce User Behavior Through Advanced Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Regarding the business of e-commerce platforms, every decision takes much financial and human resource costs. It is of great importance to understand how to drive their sales effectively. However, with the vast amount of user data, extracting useful information and discovering what factors influence customers' shopping habits poses significant challenges. This project introduces a data-driven pipeline that employs data mining techniques to process, analyze, and predict customer behavior. Experimental data was collected from Alibaba and contains customer behavior on the website Taobao over two weeks in 2017. The pipeline starts with data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis with visualizations. Then, customer segmentation based on RFM analysis and K-means clustering is implemented to divide customers into groups through their historical behavior [6]. Finally, each user's behavior sequence is modeled by recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant LSTM. The trained models can perform user behavior forecasting. This comprehensive approach can help the platform to gain valuable insights into their customer, leading to making more informed and cost-effective business decisions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Pricing Optimization in E-commerce Marketplaces</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Pricing transparency is essential in online commerce to drive transactions and influence customer decisions. Dynamic pricing, a strategy to optimize sales and profit margins, remains crucial for online merchants. Questions/purposes: This study proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for dynamic pricing optimization in e-commerce, aiming to maximize revenue and profitability. Utilizing the Online Retail II Data Set, which includes diverse product categories and customer segments, we developed a DRL framework that adapts prices based on temporal data dynamics, market conditions, competitor actions, and customer preferences. The state space incorporates key features like product demand, inventory levels, competitor prices, and time-based variables. An agent is trained through a deep reinforcement learning architecture to learn optimal pricing strategies that balance long-term revenue and ethical considerations such as price fairness. Experimental comparisons with baseline models demonstrate the proposed framework’s superior performance in enhancing revenue and profitability. The data-driven and automated approach enables e-commerce businesses to respond flexibly to market changes, improving competitiveness and customer satisfaction. The proposed DRL framework represents a significant advancement in dynamic pricing strategies, offering a flexible, responsive, and autonomous approach to pricing optimization in the digital marketplace, ultimately enhancing revenue and profitability while maintaining ethical standards.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multi-Channel Sales Forecasting in a Kenyan Retail Environment</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The fast and continuous progress in technology is significantly impacting not only the dynamics of retail and e-commerce but also the innovations in sales forecasting. Identifying what could potentially be the most effective method available for predicting sales across online and offline sales channels in this rapidly growing market is becoming more and more crucial to business owners. This study on multi-channel retailing examines the performances of conventional time series forecasting models ARIMA/SARIMA and the more recent approaches like Facebook Prophet and RNN. For this purpose, Kenyan retail time series data of three years was utilized. Our findings highlight that among these methods, LSTM emerges as the top performer, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing the complex characteristics of the sales data. It is also important to note that based on the results of the experiments, SARIMA still has potential especially in short-term predictions of time series with strong seasonality.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Deep Learning Based Hybrid Model for Sales Prediction of E-commerce with Sentiment Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The market of E-commerce has developed rapidly since the emergence of Internet. Many companies or shops of E-commerce want to seek a way to predict the sales of their products. The prediction of sales can help the merchants to formulate a sales strategy, in order to obtain a bigger profit and attract more investment. However, many studies simply use the daily sales or some very basic daily information of the product to predict the sales, without considering the effects of reviews. In this paper, a hybrid network including Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to solve this prediction task. Through careful selection, several attributes and comments of the products are utilized. Feature engineering is used to normalize the different kinds of data. BiLSTM is conducted to analyze all the comments. CNN is utilized to make predictions by using the data provided by feature engineering. Analysis is described to show the advantages and effectiveness of this network. By using the attributes of the product, along with the polarization of comments, CNN can predict the sales of the product.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Novel Approach to Visual Search in E-commerce Fashion Using Siamese Neural Network and Multi-Scale CNN</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The growing number of users on fashion e-retail platforms has highlighted the limitations of the current text-based search system, as users struggle to effectively describe the clothing products they are searching for. To address this challenge, the integration of a visual search system becomes essential. Visual search allows users to find similar products based solely on images. In this research, we propose the utilization of a Siamese Neural Network for implementing visual search in an e-commerce fashion. The Siamese network consists of two identical networks that process different images. By training the network to learn and represent the differences between images as embedding vectors, we enable the generation of similarity scores for pairs of images. To achieve accurate feature extraction, we employ a Multi-Scale CNN approach that captures both high and low-level features. Various experiments are conducted in this study, including the selection of multi-scale CNNs, distance metrics, and diverse data, to determine the network architecture that achieves the highest accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that utilizing the VGG19 model with a shallow layer and fractional distance metrics achieves an impressive accuracy of up to 97%. This indicates the effectiveness of our model in accurately predicting image similarity.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Implementation of Models for Demand Forecasting for e-Commerce using Time Series Forecasting</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The study delves into the significance of demand forecasting within the e-commerce realm, crucial for businesses to anticipate future customer needs and optimize inventory management and resource allocation strategies. Focusing on employing time series forecasting methodologies, specifically XGBOOST and SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous factors) models, the research aims to predict demand accurately in e-commerce scenarios. By analyzing historical sales data and integrating pertinent external variables like promotional events and seasonal trends, these models endeavor to forecast forthcoming demand trends for a variety of products or services offered bye-commerce platforms. The investigation scrutinizes the intricacies of the XGBOOST and SARIMAX models, highlighting their merits and limitations in the context of e-commerce demand forecasting. Moreover, the study assesses model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to gauge accuracy and reliability in demand prediction. The SARIMA model deployed in this work has a MAPE value of 0.027 which is better than any previously formed SARIMA models on this particular dataset. The XGBOOST model implemented in this work has RMSE value of 2852.098 which is lesser than any of the work done on this dataset before. Also, the calculated accuracy comes out to be 98.348% for XGBOOST which is remarkable and is best on this data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-Commerce Personalized Recommendation Based on Convolutional Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>There is a local sparsity of user interest data in current e-commerce, resulting in low accuracy of personalized product recommendation. An item personalized recommendation model based on improved local similarity prediction of CNN (LSPCNN) is constructed. Firstly, the convolutional neural network CNN is used to extract local features. Then, a regulating layer is added on the basis of CNN network, and the item scoring matrix is constructed for the initial users to make their interest locally characterized. Finally, CNN is used to predict the missing score, thus realizing personalized recommendation. Experimental results show that compared with the improved CNN network model and the collaborative filtering recommendation model based on hybrid neural network, the data sparsity of the proposed LSPCNN model is significantly reduced, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is smaller. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can accurately extract the local feature data that users are interested in, which improves the accuracy of e-commerce personalized recommendation, and has certain feasibility.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Dynamic Demand Forecasting with AI: Maximizing Supply Chain Value</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents the development of a dynamic demand forecasting platform designed to predict demand accurately and quantify its added value in supply chain management using advanced machine learning and operations management algorithms. The platform collects and processes real-time data from multiple sources, including point-of-sale systems, e-commerce transactions, competitor pricing, weather conditions, and consumer sentiment data. By integrating environmental and product-specific factors, the platform optimizes inventory levels, delivery routing, and operational efficiency. It achieves superior predictive accuracy by leveraging models such as XGBoost and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which consistently outperform traditional methods. The solution is designed to be scalable, cost-effective, and user-friendly, making it particularly accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that often struggle to implement advanced forecasting systems due to technological and financial constraints. The system's implementation significantly enhances decision-making processes, resulting in reduced operational costs and improved customer satisfaction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Advanced Skin Category Prediction System for Cosmetic Suggestion using Deep Convolution Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, cosmetic products are quite important to a person’s look. Customers get access to a variety of products through online shopping and e-commerce websites. It is highly challenging to choose the ideal product for human skin. As such, this study proposed a novel system to accurately determine suitable product based on the skin type. The composition depends on skin types, which might be dry, oily, or normal. The composition proposal will be superior to the established method. This skin product selection process is made easier by utilizing deep learning techniques. The beauty sector is expanding rapidly over time, which has a positive knock-on effect on both the products it offers and its customers. The rapid growth of products and customers underscores the importance of choosing the right cosmetic product. There is a necessity to choose the ideal cosmetic product for oneself based on personal factors because cosmetics are important to one’s personality (i.e., skin type). As every person has a different skin texture, it might be challenging to find the right cosmetic for a customer’s skin type. Even if the right product for the consumer is selected, skin problems can still arise due to various complex issues. For solving this problem in the beauty industry, AI algorithms can be used as they provide better results when working with vast amounts of unstructured data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Rate Insight: A Comparative Study on Different Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Product Review Rating Prediction in Bengali Language</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this contemporary era of digital marketing, ecommerce has emerged as one of the most preferred methods for day-to-day shopping. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, online shopping behavior has forever changed to less or no human-to-human interaction. As a result, it is getting more difficult for e-commerce enterprises to observe and evaluate market trends, particularly when done through consumer behavior analysis. To identify behavioral patterns and customer review-rating discrepancies, extensive analysis of product reviews is a substantial research field. Lack of benchmark corpora and language processing techniques, predicting review ratings in Bengali has become increasingly problematic. This paper thoroughly analyzes the approach to product review rating prediction for Bengali text reviews exploiting our own constructed dataset that was collected from an e-commerce website called DarazBD1. We acquired product reviews with labels known as ratings of five sentiment classes, from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;5&quot;. It is noteworthy that we established a well-balanced dataset using our automated scraping system and a significant amount of time and effort is spent to maintain quality standards through the human annotation process. Exploration of multiple approaches to machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, multinomial naïve Bayes, and support vector machine, the best classification accuracy score of 78.63% is achieved by SVM. Subsequently, using Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe embeddings with three deep neural network(DNN) architectures: CNN, Bi-LSTM, and a combination of CNN and Bi-LSTM, CNN+Bi-LSTM gave the highest accuracy score of 75.25% among the DNN architectures.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting of E-commerce Platform Based on ARIMA and LSTM Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper focuses on an in-depth study of inventory management issues in e-commerce platforms. Merchants need to balance between the high capital pressure caused by more inventory and the risk of out-of-stock that may be caused by less inventory. Firstly, this paper preprocesses the data of the e-commerce platform, merges the time series data, and deals with the outliers, forecasts the demand for goods through the ARIMA model, and evaluates the model effect by using the RMSE and 1-wmape indicators. Secondly, for the data of new products due to insufficient sample size, this paper used K-means clustering model for similarity classification and predicted future sales accordingly. Finally, for large-scale promotions, this paper predicts the demand under the influence of promotions through data preprocessing and LSTM model, and the 1-wmape indicator shows that the prediction effect of LSTM model is better than that of ARIMA model. The methods and conclusions of this study are of great practical significance for optimizing the inventory management of e-commerce platforms and improving supply chain efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Forecasting method of e-commerce cargo sales based on ARIMA-BP model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In order to prevent merchants from occupying a large amount of cash flow due to unreasonable replenishment and the waste of resources and loss of profits caused by goods in short supply, a reasonable forecast of sales volume is particularly important. This article used the ARIMA-BP nonlinear combination model to predict the sale of merchants' goods. Two separate prediction models, the BP neural network and the ARIMA, were used to predict the sales volume in the next 5 days, and then a mean square error model was established to weight the fitting and predictive results of the two single predictions. The weight obtained is brought into the BP neural network model for training, and one is obtained The dynamic weight model is used to predict the dynamic weight of two single prediction models in the next five days. Finally, the test data was substituted into the model, and the normalized error is 0.05363. The research shows that the model can adapt to the problem of forecasting the sales volume of e-commerce goods, more stable, and the error of the combined prediction is much smaller than a single prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on Optimization of Personalized Algorithm of E-Commerce Recommendation System Based on Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Traditional recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering and content filtering, have limitations in the face of big data, diversity of user behavior and complexity of product characteristics, such as data sparsity, cold start problem and difficulty in capturing users' deep-seated interests. In this study, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used as the basic model to construct a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure. The input layer receives the features of users and commodities, the hidden layer extracts high-dimensional features through multi-layer nonlinear transformation, and the output layer gives the prediction score or preference probability of users to commodities. In the aspect of feature extraction and selection, the user's basic information is digitally encoded, the historical behavior data is transformed into vector form, the interest tag is embedded with words, the commodity basic information category is uniquely encoded, the price is normalized, the text is transformed into vectors by pre-trained BERT model, and the image is extracted with pre-trained ResNet model. Finally, the user feature vector and commodity feature vector are spliced to form DNN input. In the aspect of algorithm optimization, MLP parameters are optimized by grid search, including the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, learning rate, activation function, etc., and DNN is combined with the traditional collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm, and CF results are added to DNN as additional features, and the overall performance of the recommendation system is improved through weighted average fusion of the two outputs. The experimental results show that the optimized DNN-CF hybrid model has the best accuracy, with the lowest RMSE of 0.95, which is better than that of DNN-only model of 1.10 and CF -only model of 1.25. The comparison between the predicted score and the actual score shows that the DNN-CF hybrid model has stronger prediction ability. This study provides an effective method for the optimization of personalized algorithm of e-commerce recommendation system, which is helpful to improve the accuracy and real-time performance of the recommendation system and enhance the user experience.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI-Driven Return Rate Prediction in Online Retail using Behavioral and Transactional Data</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The explosive growth of e-commerce has created unprecedented problems in handling product returns, with online return rates frequently in excess of 30% of all sales. The present review is a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods in predicting return rates in online retail settings based on behavioral and transactional data. By structured review of recent literature and empirical testing on a dataset of 6,600 customer transactions, this paper integrates existing methodologies, determines important predictive features, and compares the performance of different machine learning methods. This paper’s findings illustrate that ensemble methods, specifically XGBoost and CatBoost, produce best results with F1-scores above 0.92, whereas behavioral features like session time, return history in the past, and transaction patterns prove to be important predictors. The review points out major shortcomings of existing research and suggests avenues for future research towards enhancing AI-powered return prediction functions in e-commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unified E-Commerce Platform Aggregator using NLP and Machine Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The study proposed the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Machine Learning (ML) techniques like ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to develop a smart predictive system for e-commerce platforms. NLP extracts insights from customer feedback, product descriptions, and social media sentiments to understand customer preferences and market trends. ARIMA, a time-series forecasting model, predicts demand fluctuations based on historical sales data, enabling better stock management, while LSTM captures long-term dependencies in sequential data for more accurate forecasting and product recommendations. By combining these techniques, the system enhances decision-making, optimizes pricing strategies, and improves customer engagement through personalized recommendations. Additionally, it helps businesses maintain an efficient inventory system by reducing overstocking and stockouts, ultimately increasing profitability. This approach not only benefits businesses but also enhances the shopping experience by making e-commerce platforms more adaptive and responsive to changing market demands. The integration of NLP, ARIMA, and LSTM ensures a data-driven strategy that leverages AI and ML to transform the e-commerce industry through predictive analytics and intelligent decision-making.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-commerce Platform Risk Identification Using AHP Hierarchical Analysis and BPNN Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are widely used in risk identification. Cross-border e-commerce platforms have increasingly become the best channel for global consumers to make purchases; however, with the surge in orders comes the risk of online purchases. Extensive quantitative data was collected through surveys and used for correlational studies that identify eight major risk factors, which are sales risk, cash/capital flow risk, market risk, customs clearance risk, shipping and delivery risk, environmental risk, logistics risk, and return risk. We then rated three online e-commerce platforms-Amazon, Ebay and Shopify-using AHP hierarchical analysis. The large number of survey responses collected, combined with the AHP scoring matrix we constructed, led to the conclusion that Shopify's online shopping risk is largest, followed by Ebay and Amazon. Based on this, we further establish and utilize BPNN neural network to predict the risk level of each website. The results show that the neural network trained in this paper has high accuracy and can be used for international e-commerce platform risk identification and evaluation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>OrgoFarm : Harnessing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Revolutionize Organic Farming and Direct-to-Consumer Marketing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the current agricultural landscape, the demand for organic products is surging due to rising health consciousness and environmental concerns. However, organic farmers face significant challenges, including inefficient disease management, unpredictable yield forecasting, and limited market access. OrgoFarm addresses these critical issues by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to enhance decision-making and streamline operations. The research work involved developing a Farmers Guide for comprehensive assistance, a Marketplace for direct farmer-to-consumer sales, and a Crop Doctor tool utilizing ResNet50 for early disease detection and organic treatment recommendations. Additionally, a Crop Yield Prediction model using LSTM was developed to forecast yields and optimize resource allocation. An AI Virtual Assistant was also implemented to provide real-time farming insights, and a Discussion Forum was created to facilitate knowledge sharing among farmers. The outcomes of the research work include improved disease diagnosis accuracy, enhanced yield predictions, and better price realization for farmers, ultimately promoting sustainability and economic viability in organic farming. By combining AI-driven analytics with a decentralized market model, OrgoFarm transforms the agricultural sector, driving progress and innovation in the industry.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Regression-based Business Decision Support: Application in Online Retail</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Electronic commerce (e-commerce) opens up various growth possibilities, with product returns being one of the major challenges. Product returns prediction can be beneficial in taking business decisions in e-commerce. This research is based on an e-commerce company in India with nearly 25% product returns as a case study. Logistic-regression-based statistical analysis was used to predict the dichotomous dependent variable (product returns). Product size, payment mode, price, quantity, ZIP codes, and states were considered as independent variables. A decision support system was proposed based on the variables and a machine learning approach. A total of 3,187 past orders were used to train the model, which was applied in a one-month pilot study. The model could predict 60% of correct product returns with an overall efficiency of 87%. The case company used these predictions to take preliminary decisions on predicted return orders, saving 17% of the costs associated with product returns.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predictive Analysis of End to End Inventory Management System for Perishable Goods</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Perishable items are the ones that quickly become spoiled or unsafe for consumption and usage. They are the core of supply chain management due to the limited shelf-life. There are many forms of perishable items viz fresh food products like fruits and vegetables, dairy, poultry, frozen or processed foods, commodities like cosmetics, health care products like medicines, oxygen and lifesaving items like blood. The paper addresses issues of the order management system in the estimation of the demands of the essential perishable items based on its fluctuating demands. The prevalent work was not able to correctly estimate the demands of the items labeled as essential goods. This article describes the identification of the most relevant features to estimate the replenishment policies. The work carried out contemplates the feature importance, exceptionally taking into account the effect of calamities or celebrations and festivities. The novelty of the work lies in comparing the complex two-step models using linear programming and reinforcement learning. The proposed model with simple machine learning algorithms is seen more effective for small scale businesses. The devised model focuses on accurately predicting the order estimate of perishable product under dynamically impacting factors in the supply chain management.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Evaporation Parameter-Ant Colony Optimization (EP-ACO) Algorithm With Elam Neural Network (ENN) for Sentiment Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent times, online shopping is major stream that refers to users for purchasing and also consume along development of internet technology. The user satisfaction is maximized efficiently through performing Sentiment Analysis (SA) of huge amount of user reviews on e-commerce platforms. That is still difficult for predicting a correct sentiment polarities of user reviews due to modifications in sequence length, order of textual with difficult logic. In this research, proposed an Evaporation Parameter-Ant Colony Optimization (EP-ACO) algorithm with Elam Neural Network (ENN) for sentiment analysis of amazon product reviews. The reviews from amazon platform are taken for sentiment analysis and then the pre-processing and word embedding process are performed. The features are selected by using EP-ACO algorithm which selects the relevant features for sentiment analysis. Then the sentiment analysis id performed by ENN network, that classifies the reviews as good or bad. Proposed technique obtained 98.26% accuracy, 97.73% precision, 97.03% recall and 97.41% f1-score that is better than previous methods like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Artificial Intelligence and Dynamic Pricing Strategies: Enhancing Competitiveness in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Dynamic pricing is vital for e-commerce companies to adapt to the dynamic pricing techniques if they have to maximize their revenues without having too much stock. To efficiently respond to changes in demand, accurate demand forecasting is central to the process of making changes in pricing. The main problem with conventional approaches to price determination is that usually there is no way the price can be changed in response to changes in the market. New developments in Fourier Analysis Networks (FANs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) present the potential for improving demand forecasts and price optimization. The objective of this work is to implement FANs for demand forecasting in parallel to an RL agent for dynamic pricing and fine-tune the RL agent via Hyperband as the hyperparameter tuning method to create an efficient and adaptive pricing model. Thus, the integration of time series demand forecast with dynamic pricing mechanism allows for daily business to change their prices according to the forecasted demands, market status, and competitive prices. The hybrid system takes the demand forecast from the FANs to facilitate the RL agent's decision to set appropriate prices. RL agent acts with the environment, changing prices based on the forecasts of demand and stock, as well as the prices of competitors. Hyperband optimization, therefore, refines the hyperparameters of the agent to increase efficiency. The findings show how the implementation of the proposed hybrid system exceeds conventional pricing models. The demand forecast accuracy of the model stood at 95.65 % to achieve better revenues uplifts. The presented framework provides the e-commerce companies with the opportunity for better adjustment and implementation of different pricing strategies to increase profitability and minimize the time spent on identification of different conditions on the market.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Intelligent Warehouse Stocking Using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In today’s era, any small or medium-sized business is required perfect stock management to fulfill the customer’s need. To do so, skilled labour with lots of money needs to be invested. E-commerce giants use Machine Learning techniques to maintain their stock based on demands produced by their buyers at various time intervals. Therefore, to predict the demand for various products and to improve their sales for either small or medium-sized businesses, Warehouse Management can be extended as a service. When we are thinking about demand forecasting, which is a crucial part of all businesses, a question comes to mind that is how much stock of an item should a company or business needs to keep to meet the demands of their customer so that their daily needs can be accomplished. The predictive forecast provides the necessary solution and also provides many benefits such as it provides an advantage of the better customer experience through the reduction of out-of-stock situations, and for lower costs due to better-planned stock. Therefore, this paper focuses on discussing the challenges of building an Intelligent Warehouse Stocking system and discusses the design decisions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Complementary Product Recommendation using Siamese Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online catalogs on e-commerce websites are sometimes too overwhelming where customers have a choice of as much variety and richness to find what they need in one place. In e-commerce websites, recommendation systems are crucial since they enhance the user experience by assisting visitors in finding what they want by recommending products. These suggestions can be based on user traits, demographics, past purchases, or search history. In this paper, we focus on identifying a complementary relationship between products, we have made a content-based recommendation system for discovering complementary products using Siamese Neural Networks (SNN). Algorithms like this have a lot of potential to increase the average purchase amount on an e-commerce website by recommending comparable products. After implementing the network we propose an extension of the network of the SNN approach to handling more products and will improve the time for recommending products by the KNN algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Demand Forecasting for E-Commerce Platforms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>It gets difficult for e-commerce companies to understand market conditions. The proposed work predicts the demand for the products as per the sales in the e-commerce companies so that there is no shortage of raw materials or the number of units on the inventory side. This paper is a comparative study of the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model and Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to predict product demand for the given dataset. Performance, scalability, execution time, accessibility and convenience are the various factors based on which the two models are compared. In SARIMA, the model with the minimum value of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was selected from all the admissible models. The nonlinear demand relationships available in the E-commerce product assortment hierarchy is exploited well by the LSTM.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Self Attentive Product Recommender – A Hybrid Approach with Machine Learning and Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>People are choosing products from online ratings and comments. Experience from Amazon, Flipkart and other leading online shopping portals in India, the buyer `s product choice is mostly based on the other buyer's review. We have found an interesting case study of Netflix video recommendation based on so many criteria. Product recommendation is one of the demanding area of recent time where efficiency of prediction of which product a buyer can choose over other hundreds of product is a challenging task. Artificial intelligence has helped researchers in developing algorithm that has self-aware method for machine with machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. In this research, we are introducing a hybrid approach of recommendation for products. There are many ways to find out the people who have similar choice and combining their choices can lead us to suggestions for other products. Collaborative filtering method has been being used for Recommender frameworks for quite a while now. They have been fruitful in comprehending numerous issues of the systems which are being used in the market. User- behavior analysis, sentiment score, product reviews, popularity score can be a decisive factor along with neural network with classification method can lead to more efficient results. In this research, we present some of more potential areas of working on Collaborative Filtering technique with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Self attentive product recommendation is one such technique which focuses on automated form for recommendation which is independent of a dataset and its data type. We have examined other approaches for joining different calculations for predicting client evaluations and furthermore examine a few outcomes from the investigation of different procedures utilized by earlier analysts and discover answers for them.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Learning Advancements in E-commerce Supply Chain Management in Forecasting and Optimization Strategies</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this study, the influence of deep learning technologies on the optimization of supply chain management in the context of the e-commerce industry is examined. Using a dataset of historical data of sales, inventories, market fluctuations, and customer and supplier details, I investigate the efficiency of different deep learning models to predict demand and facilitate the optimal balance of inventories. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a model proposed by the authors are defined and applied, considering their accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. The results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional products, achieving 97.5% of accuracy. In the context of the comparative analysis, the specific features of CNN, LSTM, and RNN are revealed, helping to understand the benefits and drawbacks of each recommendation. As a result, the proposed model proves that deep learning technologies have the power to change the approach to predictive analytics and supply chain management, allowing practitioners to focus on strengths and overcome the weaknesses of their structures. The impact of data preprocessing and hyperparameters is also considered along with the necessity to choose the most appropriate model evaluation technique. In the future, it is possible to implement other complex deep learning models, integrate additional data, and address the problem of data scaling and heterogeneity. In the era of modern technologies, e-commerce organizations should take these findings into consideration to discover the potential of deep learning, improve supply chain performance, reduce costs, and attract clients. This research contributes to the topic of using deep learning technologies in supply chain management, promoting innovation, and changes that may affect the industry drastically.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing E-Commerce Using Fashion Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce faces difficulties in attaining personalized shopping experiences with which improved customer satisfaction and also increases sales. Traditional recommender systems often fail at giving appropriate predictions for user interest; this causes lower activity rates and even retention among the users. A recommended fashion e-commerce system is built here with the integration of the convolutional neural network technology that further enhances image-based analyses on the products. The user system has two modules here, the Admin and the User module. The Admin module manages inventory, tracks purchases, and maintains database integrity, and the user module provides an interface to browse products with personalized recommendations. The system analyzes product images and user behavior to provide accurate real-time suggestions by using CNNs along with collaborative filtering. This helps in better decision-making, reduces browsing time, and increases sales by targeted recommendations. The proposed system is therefore about revolutionizing the online shopping experience through the introduction of a smart, user-centric solution: thus, customer satisfaction and competitive advantage in e-commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Robust Artificial Intelligence Enabled Methodology to Predict Online Consumers Behaviour Using Hybrid Deep Learning Strategy</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Marketing and consumer behavior predictions are two areas where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is finding widespread use. Evaluating the accuracy of AI -based consumer behavior prediction is the focus of this article. Evidence from research in this area suggests that AI can help sift through mountains of data pertaining to customer performance. It includes looking at things like customer surveys, purchasing history, and behaviour. Furthermore, this sector may make use of deep learning techniques for consumer behavior forecasting. All sorts of advertising and marketing choices can benefit from this data. The Hybrid Learning for Behavioral Prediction (HLBP) method, first proposed in this study, integrates AI -assisted learning with categorization logic for processing. In order to assess the efficacy of the suggested program, this model is cross-validated with the traditional learning model known as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Even more encouraging is the possibility that AI can aid businesses in fine-tuning their advertising strategies. As a result, advertising may be more precisely targeted, and marketing budgets can be more efficiently used. Here, AI in a marketing context may provide customized experiences for consumers, such making better product recommendations and enhancing the shopping experience overall. In order to maximize the effectiveness of online advertising efforts, artificial intelligence can be employed. This research delves into the potential of artificial neural networks to identify customer behavior utilizing data collected from conventional surveys. Neural networks outperform classical discriminant analysis in most cases, demonstrating their strong discriminate potential.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Implementation of models for Demand forecasting for e-commerce using time series forecasting</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The study delves into the significance of demand forecasting within the e-commerce realm, crucial for businesses to anticipate future customer needs and optimize inventory management and resource allocation strategies. Focusing on employing time series forecasting methodologies, specifically XGBOOST and SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) models, the research aims to predict demand accurately in e-commerce scenarios. By analyzing historical sales data and integrating pertinent external variables like promotional events and seasonal trends, these models endeavor to forecast forthcoming demand trends for a variety of products or services offered by e-commerce platforms. The investigation scrutinizes the intricacies of XGBOOST and SARIMAX models, highlighting their merits and limitations in the context of e-commerce demand forecasting. Moreover, the study assesses model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to gauge accuracy and reliability in demand prediction. The insights gleaned from this study contribute to advancing demand forecasting techniques in e-commerce, offering valuable guidance for businesses aiming to refine operational efficiency and elevate customer satisfaction through precise demand projections. The SARIMA model deployed in this work has a MAPE value of 0.027 which is better than any previously formed SARIMA models on this particular dataset. The XGBOOST model implemented in this work has RMSE value of 2852.098 which is lesser than any of the work done on this dataset before. Also the calculated accuracy comes out to be 98.348% for XGBOOST which is remarkable and is best on this data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-Commerce Products Personalized Recommendation Based on Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To solve the problem that the recommendation accuracy of electronic products is low, a personalized recommendation model for e-commerce products based on BERT-BiLSTM was proposed. The two pre-training tasks in the BERT model were used to realize the bidirectional language model. Then, on this basis, the bidirectional neural network BLSTM was introduced to obtain the contextual semantic information of the text, which was output after combining the output of forward and backward hidden layers. Experimental results showed that compared with the benchmark model, BERT-SVM model, BERT-RNN model and BERT-LSTM model, the RMSE value of personalized recommendation model for e-commerce products based on BERT-BiLSTM is the lowest, which is 0.82, which means that the recommendation accuracy of the proposed model is the highest. Therefore, the proposed model is feasible in personalized recommendations for ecommerce products.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Development of Machine Learning Based Fraudulent Website Detection Scheme</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The development of mobile computing and e-commerce has greatly changed traditional transactions and grown online shopping. People are buying and selling goods on websites or social platforms. However, there are many malicious and counterfeit products on fraudulent websites to deceive consumers and make high improper profits. Due to the obvious increase in the number of such fraudulent websites, it is difficult to identify and detect these websites by manual inspection. In order to solve this problem, we propose an intelligent detection mechanism by using a machine learning approach to classify fraudulent websites. We use data set containing 300 legitimate websites, 300 fraudulent websites, and 15 features for training. In two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks, we divided the training set and the test set in a ratio of 8:2. Finally, the prediction is compared with the previous research results. The experimental results show that the RF accuracy of the random forest algorithm is 99.3% which is better than other deep neural networks algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Stock&amp;Buy: A New Demand Forecasting Tool For Inventory Control</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Demand forecasting is playing a crucial role for many retail firms where effective inventory management allows accurate balance between demands and offers. One of the most common methods for demand forecasting is by analyzing previous data to help predicting future demands/supplies. This work presents a growing online retail platform, Stock&amp;Buy, to integrate a demand forecasting tool. First, a forecasting pipeline is designed where extensive literature review and pre-analyzing data allowed to make the most appropriate decisions to reach high accuracy. After that, a new demand-forecasting tool, Comb-TSB, is proposed for intermittent and lumpy demand patterns. Comb-TSB automatically selects the most accurate model among a set of methods. Besides, a clustering-based approach (ClustAvg) is proposed to forecast demand for new products which have very few or no sales history data. The evaluation process showed that the proposed tool achieves good forecasting accuracy by making the most appropriate choice while defining the forecasting method to apply for each product selection.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sentiment Polarity Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As e-commerce has grown in recent years, so online shopping has increased with the number of product reviews posted online. The consumer's recommendations or complaints influence significantly customers and their decision to purchase. Sentiment polarity analysis is the interpretation and classification of text-based data. The main goal of our work is to categorize each customer's review into a class that represents its quality (positive or negative). Our sentiment polarity detection consists of the following steps: preprocessing, feature extraction, training, classification and generalization. First, the reviews were transformed into vector representation using different techniques of Tf-Idf and Tokenizer. Then, we trained with a machine learning model of SVM Linear, RBF, Sigmoid kernel and a deep learning model LSTM. After that, we evaluated the models using accuracy, f1-score, precision, recall. Our LSTM model predicts an accuracy of 86% for Amazon-based customer reviews and an accuracy of 85% for Yelp customer reviews.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Semantic Analysis on Product Review Headlines Based on Review Association Mechanism and Convolutional Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of online shopping, product reviews and star ratings have an important impact on users' shopping behaviors, and the reviews can also urge merchants to improve their products. This article explores the internal connection between product reviews and star ratings, analyzes the key factors which deeply affect the star ratings, and constructs a review association mechanism based on high-frequency keywords to provide supplementary information for products with missing text reviews, which offers some valuable suggestions to merchants. At the same time, this article uses the headline which highly summarizes each product review to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN), and predicts the star ratings with high accuracy, which can also help users and merchants better understand those product reviews without star ratings.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting purchase probability of retail items using an ensemble learning approach and historical data</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Planning for stocking and supply chain management of retail markets is critical to ensure the high availability of retail items while reducing the risks of oversupply and overstocking. The ability to predict purchase probability of retail items accurately and efficiently is critical to enable such optimized supply chain management. In this paper, we use historical purchase data, carry out pre-processing, analysis, as well as build an ensemble learning-based model to efficiently predict purchase probability of retail items. The proposed ensemble learning model is composed of different segments utilizing Random Forests, Convolution Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and voting mechanism. Detailed evaluation of the proposed solution was carried out by analyzing accuracy, precision, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and more. The evaluation further included efficiency analysis, complexity analysis. The proposed solution performed better than the existing solutions, as shown in the evaluation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>IoT-Based Customer Behavior Patterns in Retail Stores Using Recurrent Neural Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The use of Internet of Things (IoT) in retail has transformed the investigation and understanding of customer behavior. This research examines the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict and model customer behavior patterns in stores using IoT-generated data. Retailers may get extensive insights into customers’ movements, preferences, and purchase choices by using real-time data from smart shelves, beacons, and other connected devices. RNNs, due to their capacity to analyze sequential data, are used to capture the temporal dynamics of customer interactions, allowing more precise predictions of shopping behaviors. To discern notable behavioral patterns, guide personalized marketing methods, and improve inventory management systems. The results underscore the capability of integrating IoT data with RNNs to enhance customer experience and improve operational efficiency in the retail industry. This research enhances the comprehension of how advanced machine learning methodologies may use IoT data to revolutionize consumer behavior analysis in a quickly changing retail environment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on a Prediction Model of Online Shopping Behavior Based on Deep Forest Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce platforms such as Taobao can collect massive users 'shopping behavior data, which makes it possible to grasp users' shopping preferences. However, the current research methods of user operation behavior prediction usually only analyze a certain type of user's operation behavior, which cannot fully reflect the overall characteristics of user behavior. Based on the shopping behavior data of Alibaba's e-commerce platform, this article mines user characteristics, product characteristics, product category characteristics, user-product characteristics, and user-product category characteristics from a large amount of online shopping behavior data. The online purchasing behavior prediction model has achieved better results than other models. Experimental results show that the model improves the accuracy of prediction while reducing the time overhead.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Item Relationship Graph Neural Networks for E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In a modern e-commerce recommender system, it is important to understand the relationships among products. Recognizing product relationships—such as complements or substitutes—accurately is an essential task for generating better recommendation results, as well as improving explainability in recommendation. Products and their associated relationships naturally form a product graph, yet existing efforts do not fully exploit the product graph’s topological structure. They usually only consider the information from directly connected products. In fact, the connectivity of products a few hops away also contains rich semantics and could be utilized for improved relationship prediction. In this work, we formulate the problem as a multilabel link prediction task and propose a novel graph neural network-based framework, item relationship graph neural network (IRGNN), for discovering multiple complex relationships simultaneously. We incorporate multihop relationships of products by recursively updating node embeddings using the messages from their neighbors. An edge relational network is designed to effectively capture relational information between products. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world product data, validating the effectiveness of IRGNN, especially on large and sparse product graphs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>DL-ASD: A Deep Learning Approach for Autism Spectrum Disorder</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Identifying a person’s feelings and sentiments is known as emotion recognition and analysis. The emotion analysis approach correctly recognizes normal people’s facial emotions in the first attempt. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who have trouble talking or expressing themselves can struggle emotionally to understand. To predict ASD and No ASD in children aged 1-10 using dynamic analysis, this work presents a robust deep learning model with multi-label categorization. We proposed a DL-ASD framework for identifying autism spectrum disorder. The proposed model has used the Kaggle dataset as an image dataset. The datasets are trained with an Improved Convolutional Neural Network (I-CNN), and the images are used to classify individuals as having autism spectrum disorder or not having ASD. Feature-based calculations of internal and exterior distances are used to identify the emotion. Optimization procedures such as dropout, batch normalization, and parameter update are used to optimize the Improved Convolutional Neural Network’s (I-CNN) processing of the returning facial landmarks. The proposed method correctly predicts six emotions in addition to four general emotions. According to the experimental results, the classification accuracy of the approach proposed in this study can reach 98%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An analysis and forecasts of online product sales based on BP Neural Network and Pearson Coefficient</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>We construct two models to derive the optimal plan. We successfully utilize our models to determine the best online sales strategy and identify potentially important design features that would enhance product desirability. We establish the Genetic Algorithm-Optimized BP Neural Network Model to find the relationship between time-based measures within data sets and the reputation of products. After quantifying all the indicators, we take BP Neural Network Model as a fitting platform to fit and forecast the reputation-timeline figure. To degrade the influence because of the slow rate of convergence, we introduce Genetic Algorithm to seek optimal global solutions and optimize BP Neural Network Model. Finally, we arrive at the conclusion that the reputation of products has potential correlations with time-based measures within data sets. We establish the Pearson Correlation Model to get the correlation between indexes. Firstly, we quantified all the indicators. According to the model analysis, we find that specific star ratings do incite more reviews. Besides, we use VADER, an NLP Sentiment Analysis Model, to quantify the sentiment descriptors of the reviews. Finally, we conclude that specific quality descriptors of text-based reviews are strongly associated with star rating level but barely associated with the helpful rating level.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>People Thoughts Prediction Using Machine Learning on Online Shopping in Bangladesh During COVID-19 Pandemic</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce business has become a prominent entity of global retail as online transaction saves time and cost at the same time. COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown accelerated the growth of e-commerce. The new e-business companies are booming rapidly whereas insincerity in customer concern is noticeable. As a result, the purchasers are facing numerous problems while buying online. The main objective of this study is to predict preferences on online shopping of buyers and based on that analysis, the pattern can be observed. While doing the study, we used some popular Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naıve Bayes (NB) algorithm. Amongst those, best accuracy was delivered by the Decision Tree algorithm. The output clearly demonstrates that, people are more likely to participate in online shopping if the obstacles could be alleviate which means, buyers are still not satisfied and confident about the online platform. Hopefully, the result of this study can be a great asset for improving the E-commerce sector of Bangladesh if it is optimized wisely.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting the Fake Review to Amazon Product Review Dataset Using Fuzzy Optimized Convolution Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce product reviews have become crucial for online users in making purchase decisions, particularly on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, where user interactions and feedback are highly emphasized. Recently, sentiment analysis is employed to assess user opinions on products by extracting valuable insights regarding various features and benefits. These reviews are widely distributed to leverage and disseminate user perspectives, providing valuable information on user sentiments in comment sections to differentiate positive and negative feedback. With the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, detecting fake reviews has become imperative to ensure the authenticity of user opinions. To address this, a fuzzy-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to differentiate genuine and fake product reviews based on user opinions and their review across similar products. The proposed architecture is designed to be resilient to temporal changes in user behavior. Initially, data preprocessing is performed to obtain user profile and product characteristics and parse statements. The preprocessed data is then subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract features representing user intentions. These features are given as input to the fuzzy-based CNN to analyze user behavior across various aspects. The obtained optimal behavioral data is utilized to train the fuzzy-optimized CNN, which provide valuable predictions on changes in user opinion towards different products. The proposed architecture employs convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected networks for review classification and fake review prediction. Performance evaluation on an Amazon product review dataset demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F-measure compared to conventional architectures.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning-driven Dynamic Pricing Strategies in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Dynamic pricing, the practice of adjusting prices in real-time based on various factors, has gained significant attention in the e-commerce industry. This paper presents a study on dynamic pricing using machine learning techniques to develop an accurate and effective pricing model. The study utilizes historical transaction data from an e-commerce platform and applies feature engineering and model selection to identify the most suitable machine learning algorithm. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) emerges as the primary model due to its ability to capture complex relationships and provide accurate predictions. The GBM model is trained and tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques, and its performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the GBM model compared to other algorithms, achieving a low MSE of 0.012 and a high R2 score of 0.92 on the validation set. The findings highlight the potential of machine learning in optimizing revenue and enhancing customer satisfaction through personalized pricing strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Gaia: Graph Neural Network with Temporal Shift aware Attention for Gross Merchandise Value Forecast in E-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce has gone a long way in empowering merchants through the internet. In order to store the goods efficiently and arrange the marketing resource properly, it is important for them to make the accurate gross merchandise value (GMV) prediction. However, it's nontrivial to make accurate prediction with the deficiency of digitized data. In this article, we present a solution to better forecast GMV inside Alipay app. Thanks to graph neural networks (G NN) which has great ability to correlate different entities to enrich information, we propose Gaia, a graph neural network (GNN) model with temporal shift aware attention. Gaia leverages the relevant e-seller’ sales information and learn neighbor correlation based on temporal dependencies. By testing on Alipay's real dataset and comparing with other baselines, Gaia has shown the best performance. And Gaia is deployed in the simulated online environment, which also achieves great improvement compared with baselines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Algorithm Optimization of AI Agent in Customer Behavior Prediction Based on Large Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of AI technology, especially the application of Large Language Model (LLM), AI Agent shows great potential in the field of customer behavior prediction. Firstly, this paper reviews the traditional methods of customer behavior prediction and points out its limitations. Subsequently, this paper proposes an algorithm optimization strategy that combines multimodal data fusion, adaptive attention mechanism and self-optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of this strategy on Online Retail data set is improved from 82.5% to 87.3%, and the F1 score is improved from 0.83 to 0.88. On the MovieLens data set, the mean square error (MSE) is reduced from 0.95 to 0.78, and the standard deviation is reduced by about 30%, which improves the stability of the algorithm. Although remarkable achievements have been made, algorithm optimization still has limitations in dealing with extremely unbalanced data sets and computing resource dependence. Future research will explore more efficient model compression technology and special processing methods for unbalanced data sets to further improve the performance and applicability of the algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Effective Model based on CNN - LSTM for E-Commerce Product Title Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The number of products posted by sellers on each e-commerce system is often very large, up to millions of products and can be many millions of times more. Therefore, product title quality control is especially important for each system. An efficient model based on the two most popular deep learning models today, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for the product title classification problem is presented in the paper. Determines whether a product title is conciseness or not. The model will use many feature groups as input, then they will be extracted again through CNN and LSTM. The combination of features generated from CNN and LSTM will form the most efficient representation vector for each title. In the experiment, we use the Vietnamese product title data set. The results have shown the superior efficiency of the proposed model compared to the base models, such as SVM, Random Forrest, and XGBoost.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Hybrid CNN-NLP System for Personalized Fashion Recommendations and Inventory Management</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce finds it difficult to provide highly personalized shopping experiences, resulting in decreased customer satisfaction and engagement. Conventional recommender systems tend to be inaccurate in predicting user preferences, which leads to decreased retention and sales. To overcome this, a fashion e-commerce system is suggested, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text data interpretation. The system makes finer recommendations based on product images, descriptions, and user behavior to provide real-time, precise suggestions. The Admin module offers superior inventory management and demand forecasting, and the User module offers an engaging shopping experience with personalized recommendations and virtual try-ons. The novelty of this system is in its hybrid mechanism, which brings together visual and textual analysis for better recommendations. This results in better decisionmaking, less browsing time, and higher sales, eventually leading to increased customer satisfaction and competitive advantage in online fashion shopping.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>OutfitX: A Deep Learning Framework for Personalized Outfit Recommendations</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The expansion of e-commerce and custom fashion has made the personalization of outfit recommendation systems crucial. Outdated approaches use manual efforts or basic rules, which do not suit specific users and their contexts. The author has worked on and proposed Outfit-X, a personalized outfit recommendation system powered by deep learning (ResNet50 classification). Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) along with metadata fusion enables the system to give contextually relevant outfit suggestions. The user takes a picture of each clothing item with a digital wardrobe application, and the application suggests suitable items (e.g., shoes, bags) in images that match them visually and semantically. Evaluations conducted using the DeepFashion dataset revealed 94.2 % accuracy in compatibility prediction, exceeding baseline models such as Siamese Networks and collaborative filtering. The system integrates explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to clarify the matching attributes in a recommendation, for example, matching colors and harmonious patterns, which helps users trust the system more.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>SMOTE Based Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, fraud correlated with credit cards became very prevalent since a lot of people use credit cards for buying goods and services. Because of e-commerce and technological advancement, most transactions are happening online, which is increasing the risk of fraudulent transactions and resulting in huge losses financially. Therefore, an effective detection technique, as the quickest prediction option, should be developed to deter fraud from propagating. This paper targeted to develop a deep learning (DL)-based model on SMOTE oversampling technique to predict the fraudulent transactions of credit cards. The system used three popular DL algorithms: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN), and measured the best performer in terms of evaluation metrics. However, the results confirm that the CNN algorithm outperformed both ANN and LSTM RNN. Additionally, compared to previous studies, our CNN fraud detection program recorded high rates of accuracy in identifying fraudulent activity. The system achieved an accuracy of 99.97%, precision of 99.94%, recall of 99.99%, and F1-Score of 99.96%. This proposed scheme can help to reduce financial loss by detecting credit card scams or frauds globally.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Hybrid Learning-Based Q-Commerce Framework Evolving from E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid evolution of E-Commerce has led to the emergence of Quick Commerce (Q-Commerce), a model that prioritizes ultra-fast deliveries and real-time decision-making. This paper proposes a Hybrid Learning-based framework that enhances Q-Commerce operations by integrating Self-Supervised, Supervised, Reinforcement, and Unsupervised Learning techniques. The model leverages BERT for self-supervised pretraining, enabling context-aware customer personalization and improved search relevance. LSTMs and CNNs are employed for demand forecasting and product classification, ensuring optimized inventory management. GNNs enhance personalized recommendations by analyzing user-product relationships. For logistics optimization, DQN and PPO are implemented to dynamically adjust last-mile delivery routes, reducing delivery times and operational costs. To ensure fraud prevention, AEs and GANs detect anomalous transaction behaviors, improving security while minimizing false positives. The proposed hybrid deployment strategy, combining cloud-based AI inference and Edge AI at micro-fulfillment centers (MFCs), enhances system responsiveness and scalability. The framework is evaluated using MAE, RMSE, HR, Fl-Score, and ROC curves, ensuring accurate demand prediction, optimized logistics, and effective fraud detection. Future advancements in Autonomous Deliveries, AI-Powered Warehousing, and Blockchain Integration will further revolutionize Q-Commerce, making it an indispensable extension of E-Commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Learning Models for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction in E-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Responding to the ever-changing e-commerce scene by utilising deep learning models for CLV forecasting in a variety of contexts. Client lifetime value is an important KPI for companies since it shows how much money customers are projected to spend while they are a part of a company's network. Improved CLV model accuracy and predictive capacity are the goals of this research, which use deep learning techniques—specifically, neural networks. In order to understand how consumer data contains temporal linkages and how these links affect purchasing behaviour, this article will look at several architectures like LSTMs and RNNs. The has two goals: first, to improve CLV estimates by analysing past transactions in detail; and second, to provide useful information for developing targeted marketing campaigns and retention-oriented programmes. The outcomes help bring e-commerce analytics and deep learning together.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Rating Prediction of Product Reviews of Bangla Language using Machine Learning Algorithms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The only way to provide feedback about a product is through reviews. When a new shopper proceeds to an online shop to purchase a product but does not have adequate time to study the reviews provided by other shoppers to get an opinion about the product, the shopper determines whether to buy the product or not on the number rating. Through reviews, shoppers can acquaint everyone about the product's quality and the manufacturer can enhance their products and business by interpreting that review. However, manufacturers demand a number review more than a text review for business analysis. This paper represents a machine learning based model for predicting the number rating from written text for Bangla product review. This study performs on a dataset collected manually from Daraz.com.bd, a Bangladeshi leading e-commerce shop. We have implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorizer on our collected dataset and record all the performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. From these above four algorithms, SVM showed more outstanding results than others in terms of performance metrics. SVM achieved 90% accuracy on the applied dataset. The other SVM performance metrics are 0.90, 0.92, and 0.91 for precision, recall and f1-score respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Learning and Sentiment Analysis Improve E-commerce Sales Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The dataset labelled “Amazon and Yelp Reviews“ is a useful resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining. It has roughly 1.5 million reviews from Amazon and Yelp for a wide range of products and services, as well as the relevant information for each review, which includes product ratings, review dates, and review titles. The dataset's size and diversity make it a good choice for training large-scale deep learning models to handle sentiment analysis tasks. The recommended approach for undertaking sentiment analysis using the “Amazon and Yelp Reviews“ dataset includes three steps: collecting data on a daily basis, preparing user comments, and applying a BiLSTM model for sentiment analysis. Assessing consumer sentiment entails evaluating comments, goods, and businesses to develop predictions about how people feel about various products and services. Some of the measures used in the model evaluation process include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 87.3%, which is comparable to existing deep learning methods such as character-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs)- LSTM and deep transfer learning. The model's errors may be evaluated to discover where it can be improved, and additional assessment metrics such as AUC- ROC, AUC-PR, G-mean, and MCC can be used to determine how well the model is doing. The dataset and methods presented have the potential to be useful for a wide range of applications, including customer feedback analysis, product and service development, and online reputation management.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Dynamic Pricing Models in E-Commerce: Exploring Machine Learning Techniques to Balance Profitability and Customer Satisfaction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This research investigates the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, paired with gradient-based optimization techniques for dynamic pricing in e-commerce. The primary objective is to develop a pricing model that effectively balances profitability with customer satisfaction by leveraging sequential data, such as time-series and customer behavior patterns. The approach utilizes LSTM’s ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, while optimization methods like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) enhance model convergence and performance. Key findings include the superior predictive accuracy of LSTM-based models over traditional approaches like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, particularly in real-time data updates and price elasticity scenarios. Additionally, the analysis revealed that LSTM models could efficiently adapt pricing strategies in response to market dynamics, significantly improving profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction. This study provides valuable insights into the application of advanced machine learning techniques in e-commerce pricing. The results suggest that LSTM-based dynamic pricing models could optimize revenue generation, offering substantial implications for pricing strategy development in modern retail environments. Future work may explore hybrid models and multi-objective optimization techniques to further refine these models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-Commerce Inventory Management System Using Machine Learning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Inventory management is a crucial requirement for small and medium-sized enterprises because significant financial and human resources are needed. Small and medium-sized enterprises can use it as a service to increase their sales and forecast demand for different products. Demand forecasting is an essential component of all businesses and raises the issue of how much inventory a firm or business should maintain to satisfy demand. In this paper, an effort is made to develop a robust inventory management model with a suitable machine learning algorithm to achieve demand forecasting. The challenges of building an Inventory system with the design decisions is discussed. Here, the model is trained using 80% of own local dataset which produced an accuracy of 63.6646% for the XGBoost model and an accuracy of 82.324% for the linear regression model. The demand forecasting model will help Small/Medium businesses to maintain inventory and minimize manual labor and hence allowing it to reduce the capital spent on maintaining inventory and simultaneously improves the profitability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Content-based Clothing Recommender System using Deep Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A recommender system primary purpose is to provide a series of item suggestions on a topic to its user. Deep learning is used in many fields and solved difficult and complex problems with large volumes of data. Deep learning can also be used in referral systems. Today, online shopping systems are looking for a method that can recommend items according to the user preference and interest in order to increase their sales. Clothing sales systems offer a set of recommendation based on the needs and interests of the users. Today, due to the current situation caused by the Coronavirus, the majority of tasks are done online. In this paper, we propose a content-based clothing recommender system using deep neural network. In content-based systems, product features are required for prediction of unobserved items ratings. In our proposed system by using a deep neural network, the cloth category is obtained and the need to manually extract the product features is eliminated by producing the required features with a large and useful volume. The advantage of this system is that it uses the same network to specify gender as a feature in making suggestions then shows the results to the user. Different machine learning algorithms are tested and analyzed with and without considering demographic information such as gender. The experimental results show that the loss of our proposed system is lower than the other related systems and solves the cold start problem for new items. Our proposed system also recommends novel, relevant and unexpected items.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multi-Class Machine Learning Models for Predicting Order Cancellations and Returns in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce became a central component of sustainable growth strategies for businesses, driven by evolving consumer behavior and accelerating digitalization.In this study, multi-class machine learning models were developed for predicting order cancellations and returns in the e-commerce sector. A real-world dataset containing \mathbf1 0, 0 0 0 order records collected from a client of Inveon, covering the period from 2020 to 2024, has been used.The performance of five classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Network (DNN), was evaluated and compared. Four feature selection techniques were applied to enhance predictive performance, including minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), Relief-F, FClassification, and a hybrid approach. Model generation has been carried out using \mathbf1 0-fold cross-validation and \mathbf3-fold grid search for hyperparameter tuning. RF- and XGBoost-based models achieved the highest performance, with F1-scores reaching up to 0,96. Regarding class-specific prediction capability, RF-, XGBoost-, SVM-, and DNN-based models yielded better results in cancellation prediction, while LR-based models performed more effectively in return prediction. Among the feature selection techniques, Relief-F and the hybrid method made the most notable contributions to model performance, especially in RF- and XGBoost-based models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Transfer Learning with Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification in the E-commerce Industry</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce has changed the way people shop and unleashed new levels of demand for goods by making it easier to buy and deliver goods to customers. There are now more choices for consumers with shorter production cycles thanks to fashion's digitization. Digital technology in the e-commerce industry is grabbing the attention of customers. The need for a system that facilitates product searching is therefore growing. Using fashion image classification, online retailers can quickly and efficiently manage the volume of their products. Use it to sort products based on their brands, types, or even styles. Fashion ensembles and even product recommendations could be created with it. Product filtering and search can benefit from the results of apparel image classification. For coarse-level image classification, a wide range of models have been successful, but only a few of them could be applied to fashion images because of the nature of the data: such images could belong to a single high-level topic like 'shirt’, ‘saree’, or ‘earrings’, but at the lower level be fine-grained (for example, 'cotton saree,' ‘long earrings’). The fine-grained hierarchy of each clothing store makes it difficult to collect a large dataset. For good predictive quality, research has shown that there is a need for machine learning techniques. Currently, there are new possibilities for vertical integration of research results into industrial or commercial applications due to recent advances in the image retrieval domain. One has to do with the difficulty sellers have when trying to upload images of their products to a marketplace and the ensuing manual tagging that occurs as a result. As a result of the classification errors, it is no longer listed in search results. Using an image-based search algorithm will allow customers to click on a picture of an object and find related products without having to type anything in. As a result, we have created a fashion industry-specific intelligent technique based on deep learning for quick searches and accurate product classifications by applying transfer learning and experiment results on proposed methodology proved that XCEPTION deep neural network model outperforms among all other networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Marketing is essential for the success of any company today, both to project itself abroad and to achieve its business objectives. The personalized approach to marketing plays a crucial role, enabling more effective interaction with potential customers and reducing errors in promotional campaigns. One way to improve personalized marketing is by using artificial intelligence to predict the effectiveness of campaigns in converting users to customers. In this study, the use of Siamese neural networks for elevation modelling in a Chilean online retail company is proposed. The results obtained using this model are presented, as well as the classical elevation modelling techniques. These results show that the Siamese neural network model achieves an increase of more than 30% compared to the area under the Qini curve, while also being competitive in other metrics. As future work, it is planned to obtain more real data to carry out a better validation of this proposal as well as to compare the model with other proposed neural networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Comparison of Deep Learning Algorithms (LSTM &amp; GRU) for Predicting Product Stocks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The retail sales sector plays a significant role in the global economy, contributing over 15% of global GDP. The rapid growth of e-commerce has made business forecasting increasingly crucial for-profit planning and operational management in the retail sector. Inaccurate predictions can lead to either stock shortages or excess inventory. If demand is underestimated, stockouts may occur, resulting in lost revenue that often cannot be recovered, as dissatisfied customers may turn to other retail options. This research aims to compare the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithms for sales prediction. The methodology involves data collection from sales databases, data preprocessing, and stock prediction using the LSTM and GRU algorithms. The model results are then denormalized, and algorithm performance is evaluated. Findings indicate that the LSTM algorithm outperforms GRU regarding RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, demonstrating greater accuracy in the dataset used. Specifically, LSTM achieved an R² of 0.83, explaining 83% of the data variance, while GRU achieved an R² of 0.70. While both algorithms are effective, GRU's performance is slightly weaker compared to LSTM.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Understanding E-Commerce Consumer Behavior with CNN-LSTM: A Data-Driven Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Companies operating in India must recognize consumer behavior patterns to succeed in its continuously changing varied market environment. This research introduces an advanced deep learning system which uses both convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory architecture to study and predict shopper actions. Behavior modeling benefits from the new model because it uses CNN networks to collect spatial features from consumer transaction data alongside search patterns meanwhile, LSTM networks help recognize time-based behavioral trends. Training and testing applied to a large-scale dataset which included an 80-20 train test separation and high-performance GPU hardware and TensorFlow PyTorch frameworks for implementation. The experimental data confirms that the new CNN-LSTM model achieves superior performance against both conventional machine learning approaches and independent deep learning models. By reaching 92.4% accuracy our model outperformed logistic regression that scored 73.8%, random forest with 81.2%, and a hybrid CNN-SVM that achieved 89.3%. The model shows dependable predictions for consumer behavior with performance results from precision to F1-score at 91.8% to 92.2% and 92.7%. Churn prediction accuracy reached levels 18 percentage points higher than baseline models and an AUC-ROC score of 0.92 validated the model as an effective discriminator. Feature importance heatmaps in subsequent analysis revealed major determinants of consumer behavior including how often they buy and spend as well as their demographic features. Businesses now have practical recommendations from the study to refine their marketing activities while elevating customer interactions. The complex Indian consumer behaviors become understandable through the proposed CNN-LSTM model which demonstrates both strong accuracy and robust performance for applications in personalized marketing and strategic business planning.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Learning and Machine Learning Techniques for Analyzing the Impact of Big Data and Analytics on Firm Profitability</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The construction firm produces various types of big data during the project development. This data arrives in a variety of types and forms, far exceeding the data administration, incorporation, and evaluation capacities of industry-standard project data approaches. Establishing appropriate profit levels and continuously monitoring them as initiatives proceed are critical managerial activities that demand statistical decision assistance. Current profit estimating methods rely on firm or industrial standards to influence their conclusions. These standards are sometimes incorrect since they do not account for project-dependent variables. Deep learning (DL), big data analytics, and firms are the most widely employed and intuitive cognitive instruments in modern ecosystems, and they have received a lot of focus for their capacity to impact company decisions. Firms can employ these innovations to offer useful data and get responses that will help them enhance their productivity and get a market edge. The possibility of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, in forecasting construction firm profitability is investigated in this study. The investigation highlights the value of big databases and demonstrates that CNN simulations outperform conventional methods, notably pointing to a noteworthy accuracy percentage of 92.6% using CNN (VGG16). These findings demonstrate that DL may draw useful conclusions from intricate construction firm data, providing substantial chances to maximize profits and boost business performance. In addition to legal and privacy concerns, the findings emphasize the necessity of infrastructural and skill funds for an effective CNN inclusion. This study adds insightful information to the conversation about DL in construction firms and helps companies navigate the cutthroat world of the marketplace.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Dynamic Pricing Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online prices can be the main thing you think about when buying because it's easy to understand. Dynamic pricing is a well-known idea. Because they are simple to understand, online costs can be the most important factor to consider when purchasing. It is not novel to consider dynamic pricing. It is extremely advantageous to many online businesses and is commonly used to increase sales and profits. This work is the outcome of continuous efforts to create a universal framework using powerful machine learning technologies. It assists clients in choosing the appropriate online store rather than the cheapest one. This approach can be used by online stores that are out of stock. Helping store owners set competitive rates by researching similar products supplied online is the aim.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Stacking Based Enhanced Sales Forecasting for E-commerce Using Ensemble Learning approaches with Multi-Scaling Data</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce and demand forecasting for large retail chains have taken the center stage in many business spheres. Sales prediction is one of the most important tools in inventory management and optimization of operations in retailing. This paper rates the applicability of some of the machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression (LR), Import Vector Machine (IVM), and Multi-Scaled Long Short-Term Memory (MLSTM) based on the ability to predict sales of big marts. Though the basic idea of LR was satisfactory, it was deficient in terms of non-linearity and categorical features, which resulted in suboptimal performance on the problem set with a high value of RMSE as 1142.004 and R2 value as very low at 0.567 on the test data. Traditional models like Linear Regression struggle with non-linear relationships in sales data, leading to suboptimal performance. The superior handling of complex relationships through SVM turned out to be better than others with RMSE at 1133.55 and an R2 value of 0.574. SVM is Effective for handling high-dimensional data but limited in capturing temporal dependencies. The MLSTM model designed to capture the temporal dependencies has had an improved accuracy with RMSE = 1086.291 and R2 = 0.6. LSTM networks are good at capturing temporal patterns but may struggle with multi-scale time dependencies. An ensemble model of LR, SVM, and MLSTM using stacking was developed. In the proposed method, each base model has been orchestrated to exploit its strength, achieving better performance of RMSE = 1050.20, MAE = 720.35 and with the R2 score of the test data as 0.65. The developed ensemble model that combines Linear Regression, SVM, and Multi-Scaled LSTM to overcome these challenges and improve sales forecasting accuracy. The scatter plot of the predicted values against the observed ones, for the ensemble model, closely followed the ideal line, therefore, showing strong predictability and stability. The method easily overcomes the weaknesses in standalone individual models and provides a more reliable and accurate tool for the forecasting of e-commerce sales and demand planning.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Demand Prediction using AutoML Based Ensemble Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The integration of AutoML and ensemble techniques plays a pivotal role in enhancing demand forecasting by automating essential processes such as model selection, data cleaning, and hyperparameter tuning. These automated features streamline the machine-learning pipeline, significantly reducing the manual effort involved in model building and ensuring faster model deployment. By combining the outputs of multiple models through ensemble techniques, the approach leverages the strengths of each model, leading to improved accuracy and robustness in demand predictions. This system generates highly accurate demand estimates, which are crucial for optimizing operations like inventory management, resource allocation, and supply chain planning. Sectors like e-commerce, retail, and tourism, where demand fluctuations are common, can particularly benefit from such precise predictions. The automation also enables businesses to make well-informed decisions without needing in-depth expertise in machine learning, allowing for quicker responses to market dynamics. Incorporating real-time data is a key area for future development. This would allow for more dynamic forecasting that responds immediately to changes in consumer behavior or external factors, further improving the accuracy of predictions. Additionally, tailoring AutoML systems to address the unique challenges of different industries, such as considering sector-specific variables and data patterns, will make the technology even more effective. Overall, the combination of AutoML and ensemble techniques enhances decision-making by offering scalable, accurate, and efficient demand forecasting solutions across industries.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Review of Efficient Methods for Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Customer Review using Machine Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The buying behavior on an E-Commerce website is overly influenced by the type of customer reviews the product receives. Increasing volume of online shopping has caused the consumer rely highly on the opinions of the other customers when making purchase decision. Not just the individual review but also the volume of reviews has an impact on the customer. However, it can be challenging for the customer as well as the businesses to analyze all these reviews to make a decision. This problem could be solved by classifying these reviews with the help of various machine learning methods by analyzing their sentiments in three different categories namely, positive, neutral and negative sentiments, which could be done using the subjective text on the web. This research paper explores various predictive models like machine learning, deep learning, transfer learning, etc. and covers the techniques and approaches for sentiment analysis of e-commerce customer review using machine learning, and find out the most efficient one of all whiles finding out the enhancement that could be made into them.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting Customer Satisfaction in Brazil E-commerce: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customers' propensity for brand loyalty, recurrent business, and positive word-of-mouth are directly influenced by the degree to which their needs are met. E-commerce happens to be one of the biggest online industries in the world which till date is not completely understood from a customer's standpoint. Brazil being a developing country is the 12th largest market for e-commerce in the world and accounts for 30 % of e-commerce in Latin America and remains largely unexplored. In this study, we used machine learning (ML) techniques such as LSTM, XGBClassifier, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and Random Forest to predict customer satisfaction using a retail dataset from Brazil. We contrasted the efficacy of these models using a variety of evaluation criteria, such as precision, recall, and Fl-score. The LSTM model had the highest accuracy with a score of 0.89, followed by the XGBClassifier with 0.83, Naive Bayes with 0.73, Logistic Regression with 0.74, Support Vector Classifier with 0.74, and Random Forest with 0.78. The superior performance of the LSTM model over other models suggests that it has superior predictive abilities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Customer Behavior Prediction using Deep Learning Techniques for Online Purchasing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce success may be improved with a deeper knowledge of how customers make purchases online. The primary emphasis of prior research has been on consumers’ intent to buy, with sales rank serving as a proxy. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a shopper’s retail buy intent would translate into action. Our goal is to get a deeper comprehension of how online shoppers use an e-commerce platform by anticipating their actions based on a huge multidimensional data sample consisting of more than 50,000 individual web sessions. In this investigation, we identified two groups of variables—platform engagement and customer characteristics—as significant predictors of retail consumers’ propensity to shop online. We also compared our deep learning approach’s predictive efficacy to that of some of the most popular supervised learning methods for forecasting, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines,Random Forests, and ANNs. When compared to other machine learning methods, the deep learning approach performed better on the same dataset. These studies will aid in the planning stages of platform creation, and they will also contribute to the growth of the academic literature on the topic of purchase forecasting for online e-commerce platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on cargo volume prediction of logistics sorting center based on LSTM</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of e-commerce industry, logistics express industry is facing increasing business pressure, logistics sorting center cargo volume prediction has become a key link to improve operational efficiency and optimize resource allocation. Based on the long short-term memory network (LSTM), this paper constructs a cargo volume prediction model. Based on the daily cargo volume data of a certain 10 sorting centers in the past four months, the daily cargo volume of each sorting center in the next 30 days is predicted by the triple standard deviation method after removing outliers. The ARIMA model is used as a comparison model to make the same prediction. The results show that the highest prediction accuracy of LSTM model is 91.31%, and the average prediction accuracy is 80.6%. The highest accuracy of ARIMA model is 85.45%, and the average prediction accuracy is 65.3%. LSTM model is superior to ARIMA model in all evaluation indexes, indicating that it has higher accuracy and adaptability in processing such complex data. The research results are of great significance for improving resource utilization and optimizing personnel arrangement decision in sorting center. Future work will explore a hybrid prediction model combining the advantages of the two models to further improve the prediction accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Designing Predictive Analytics Frameworks with ML for ERP-Supported E-Commerce Systems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid growth of online shopping has led businesses to seek advanced technologies and creative skills to manage data effectively. This enhances resource efficiency, streamlines organizational processes, and ultimately improves company performance. This study presents a predictive analytics framework for ERP-supported e-commerce systems using ML and DL models. Leveraging the Fashion-MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples), the dataset underwent preprocessing, including noise removal, logarithmic transformations, normalization, and feature extraction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Dimensionality reduction via t-SNE aided data visualization. A CNN-based classification model outperformed other models, achieving 92.43% training and 90.42% testing accuracy, compared to Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (76%), Support Vector Machines (79%), and ResNet18 (68.29%). This framework highlights the potential of ML-driven predictive analytics in enhancing ERP-based e-commerce systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Predicting E-Commerce Product Ratings</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Big data has been the center of attention for industry due to the volume of data that is being generated and growing over time. Machine learning algorithms are being employed more and more to anticipate various features of products. Product ratings are one of the key metrics used by every firm to evaluate the performance of its products. The product rating methodology persuades customers to purchase any item. It also demonstrates a product's potential for success in the consumer market. In order to forecast a product's rating based on its category, listed price, reduced price, and number of ratings, this study used a machine learning model. The Amazon dataset, which is accessible on Kaggle, was used in this study. This study evaluates various machine learning models using a dataset of 61,950 electronics appliance entries from Amazon to predict product ratings based on category, listed price, reduced price, and number of ratings. The Random Forest model outperforms others, with a precision of 0.65 and recall of 0.6 for 1-star ratings, and demonstrates superior performance for 2-star, 4-star, and 5-star predictions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting Future Ratings of Amazon Products Based on the Users’ Prior Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The innovative approach, customer-centric service, and diverse product range have established Amazon as the leading e-commerce platform. Every day, thousands of users rely on Amazon.com for online shopping, often depending on user feedback to make purchase decisions. However, this reliance poses a challenge for newly listed products, which typically lack substantial user reviews. This scarcity of feedback can adversely affect buyers’ decisions. Our analysis focuses on the large dataset of Amazon Fine Food reviews, an extensive collection of usergenerated reviews on food products sold on the platform. The primary objective is to develop a method for estimating ratings for products with few reviews. We aim to create a system that provides valuable insights, even with limited data. Despite the scarcity of information, our model has successfully generalized unseen data, demonstrating low prediction errors. Across the 19 datasets analyzed, the Mean Square Error, normalized for the total number of datasets, was a low 0.153. This shows our model’s effectiveness in offering helpful information and predictions under data constraints. In the future, we want to improve the model by fine-tuning the hyperparameters.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on abnormal inventory detection algorithm in warehouse management system</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm with multi-model fusion architecture for the problem of inventory anomaly detection in e-commerce warehouse management. The algorithm combines the improved local anomaly factor algorithm with the recurrent neural network of attention mechanism, and fuses the multi-model results through Bayesian model averaging. Validated on a real e-commerce inventory dataset containing 12,358 SKUs, the detection F1 score reaches 87.3%, which outperforms existing methods. The algorithm shows strong robustness and adaptability to identify multiple types of inventory anomalies, and has been successfully applied to real production environments, significantly reducing inventory costs and improving order fulfilment rates.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-commerce Sales Forecast Based on Ensemble Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce, driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry, becomes one of the fastest-growing industries and has become the largest sector of the electronics industry in recent years. Compared with the traditional offline business, E-commerce business eliminates geographical limitations by allowing consumers to purchase anywhere. Additionally, E-commerce only requires a web-based platform to start a business, resulting in a lower investment or business capital. Based on more than 75,000,000 transactions of one E-commerce company from January 2013 to June 2019, we analyze the economic impact of the holiday season, the relationship between price and sales, etc. Furthermore, we utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to predict the sales of products. Here, assemble learning models, including Catboost, GBDT, LightGBM, and XGBoost, are adopted for regression prediction. The results show that Cat boost performs better than other methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Cross-Border E-Commerce User Behavior Analysis Algorithm Based on Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the field of cross-border e-commerce, enterprises need to understand and predict user behavior, because this is crucial, and it can affect the accuracy of product recommendations and the effectiveness of marketing strategies. Based on the deep learning algorithm and RNN model, this paper explores its application value in analyzing and predicting cross-border e-commerce user behavior. As a deep learning algorithm, RNN can effectively process user behavior data due to its powerful performance in sequential data processing. Based on this, this paper uses theoretical analysis, qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, and empirical analysis methods to comprehensively evaluate the different performance of RNNs in different types of user behavior prediction, and compare them with other common models. The results show that RNN is a superior deep learning algorithm, based on which the system can effectively capture the time dependence of user behavior and greatly improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency. Finally, this paper also focuses on the analysis of the specific application strategies and subsequent challenges of deep learning in actual cross-border e-commerce platforms, so as to provide sufficient application guidance and suggestions for e-commerce enterprises.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Hybrid SVD-ARIMA Method for Sales Forecasting with Sparse Data on E-Commerce Products</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In online business, predictive analytics or forecasting is often used to improve performance effectiveness. One of the forecastings that play an important role in most businesses is sales forecasting. The results of sales forecasting are used to make stock planning and the right decisions for the future. Several previous studies on forecasting preferred to use available methods. Besides, there were also some studies that combined or compared several forecasting methods to produce higher accuracy. However, in the testing process, those studies were still carried out with non-sparse data. Therefore, the Hybrid method between Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Autoregressive Integrative Moving Average (ARIMA) is used to do sales forecasting in this study. SVD method is used to predict sparse data. The ARIMA method is then used to forecast sales based on data from the SVD method. The research results on monthly forecasting using sparse data of 40% have an average RMSE and MAE values improvement of 0.308 and 0.352, respectively. For monthly forecasts that use 50% sparse data, the average RMSE and MAE values improvement are 0.279 and 0.28, respectively. For daily forecasting using sparse data of 40%, the average RMSE and MAE values improvement are 0.021 and 0.014, respectively. For daily forecasting using 50% sparse data, the average RMSE and MAE values improvement are 0.017 and 0.009, respectively. The accuracy results show that the Hybrid SVD-ARIMA method can perform forecasts better than the ARIMA method. However, in daily forecasting, the Hybrid SVD-ARIMA method still has a high forecasting error.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Experimental Evaluation of Smart Credit Card Fraud Detection System using Intelligent Learning Scheme</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>There has been an uptick in the incidence of fraudulent financial activity. The expansion of e-commerce and online payment systems has been connected to an increase in the number of instances of financial fraud, such as fraudulent use of credit cards. Because of this, it is extremely vital to put in place systems that are able to detect the theft of credit cards. The use of stolen credit cards is on the rise all across the world, and immediate action is required to tackle this growing problem. Because the major goal of the system is to protect users from being charged for products and services that they did not approve, setting a limit on this kind of conduct is in the users' best interests. It is essential to pick the characteristics of fraudulent transactions very carefully when employing machine learning for the purpose of detecting fraudulent credit card activity. Over the course of time, the fraudulent acts do not follow any identifiable pattern. Criminals are able to successfully commit acts of online fraud because to the utilization of newly developed technology. Because fraud is an ever-evolving crime, an effective fraud detection model has to be able to adjust to new circumstances and get better over time. We offer the Intelligent Learning Scheme for Digital Fraud Detection (ILSDFD), in this research. ILSDFDD is an engine for the detection of credit card fraud that is based on deep learning and makes use of the feature selection process and classification principles. The suggested remedy is deep learning, which is an unsupervised learning process that uses back-propagation and is based upon auto encoder network. This is accomplished by keeping the inputs and outputs equal to one another. Deep learning was included into the Auto Encoder that was utilized for this research using a Python-based development platform. The accuracy, precision, and recall of a model are the criteria that are used to determine how successful it is. The proposed algorithm is cross-validated with the conventional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme ILSDFD. The outcomes demonstrated that our suggested approach outperforms the other contestants' strategies and that the previously discussed techniques improve prediction accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI-Powered Smart Inventory Management: Enhancing Efficiency Through Predictive Analytics and Automation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Traditional inventory management systems suffer from inefficiencies, manual intervention, and high error rates. This paper presents an AI-driven smart inventory system using QR code scanning, machine learning (Random Forest, Linear Regression), and predictive analytics for real-time stock tracking and sales forecasting. A Raspberry Pi 5 with webcams enables automated product scanning, achieving 99.2% accuracy with 0.9s latency. Out of the two models Random Forest model indicated higher R-squared of 0.89 compared to the Linear regression model with R-squared of 0.68. The system improves inventory efficiency by predicting demand trends and alerting users about low stock levels. Security measures include QR code authentication, role-based access control, and AES-256 encryption to protect inventory data. Compared to traditional systems and commercial solutions like SAP and Oracle, our approach is cost-effective, scalable, and suitable for small to medium-sized businesses. Future work includes API integration with e-commerce platforms and warehouse automation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Construction of Data Analysis and Forecasting Model for Supply Chain Channels Based on the Internet of Things</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In order to solve the problem of data analysis and demand prediction in supply chain channel management, this paper presents a solution based on Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. Through the collection, processing, and analysis of the sales data from the e-commerce platform, the key factors that affect the sales are identified, including price, rating, and promotion efforts. On this basis, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network (LSTM) is constructed, and a system including data management, data analysis, demand prediction and visualization is designed and realized. The system uses a front end and a back end separation architecture, using Kafka, Spark Streaming to collect and process data in real time, and MySQL and MongoDB to store and manage data. Based on the development process of software engineering, the design, implementation and testing of the system are carried out. Finally, the validity of the proposed solution is verified by testing and evaluating real data, and it is very important to improve supply chain management.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Advancing Sustainable Marketing through Empowering Recommendation: A Deep Learning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the contemporary era, online shopping has become the preferred mode of retail for consumers. Addressing users' demands for personalized products while simultaneously promoting sustainable marketing practices is of paramount importance for major e-commerce platforms. This paper explores the integration of deep learning techniques into recommendation systems, focusing on the Inception structural neural network (NCF-i), to enhance prediction accuracy and operational efficiency. We also introduce sustainable marketing concepts into the context of personalized recommendations. To achieve this, we design a pairwise self-encoder that improves the content-aware recommendation algorithm for sustainable and personalized products, leveraging the gate attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed recommendation system not only outperforms current mainstream models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability but also fosters sustainable marketing practices, showcasing its effectiveness and broad applicability</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on Online Shopping Mall Product Classification Recommendation Based on Graph Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The practical application of graph neural networks in online shopping malls is a significant area within real-life scenarios. As neural network technology continually advances, an increasing emphasis is being placed on how to efficiently leverage graph data for enhancing the functionality and performance of these e-commerce platforms. Nonetheless, prevailing methodologies commonly employ conventional adjacency matrices or basic attention mechanisms to consolidate and model data pertaining to items, users, and their interactions. To some extent, these approaches overlook the intricacy of graph structures and prove challenging to implement effectively on a grand scale. Running on graph data requires a large amount of computing resources, leading to performance issues. To address these issues, we propose a new method based on hierarchical transformation aggregation model to process graph data in online shopping malls more efficiently. This method first selects nodes at various levels and regions through random walks, and then uses graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) for information aggregation. Upon acquiring node features for each layer, a transformed attention mechanism is further introduced to more effectively consolidate the node features from every layer, thereby obtaining the ultimate representation of each node. This method better captures the local and global characteristics of graph data by considering node information at different levels, improving the performance and user experience of the mall. Ultimately, we substantiate the dependability of this model through multiple real-world dataset validations, thereby evidencing its practical application feasibility in online shopping malls. This method based on the hierarchical transformation aggregation model provides a more efficient way for malls to process and analyze graph data, and is expected to improve the performance of recommendation systems, personalized recommendations, and user shopping experience.</dcterms:abstract>

Due to the ubiquity of the Web and versatile gadgets, companies can gather an expansive sum of shopper behavior information, counting social media intelligent, e-commerce clicks and obtaining behaviors, item surveys, etc. Conventional investigation strategies have restrictions in preparing such complex information, while CNN is able to automatically extract informative features, fitting for training unstructured data like images, videos, and text. To begin with, the essential principles of CNN, its composition, are introduced, including input layer, convolutional layer, activation layer, pooling layer, and totally connected layer, along with their functions in feature extraction and model establishment. After that, it goes to demonstrate the pre-processing and visualization of a retail sales and customer behavior dataset and constructs a CNN model to predict a classification of whether a customer is churned or not. It demonstrates very perfect performances in terms of accuracy, AUC, precision, and F1 score from the CNN model. Moreover, the paper compares CNN against a number of alternative classification methods: logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest, plain Bayes, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron. Comparative results demonstrate that CNN models work better in most classic classifiers on consumer behavior analysis. The article finally summarizes the potential of CNNs in consumer behavior analysis and looks forward to the future with the continuous progress of deep learning technology and rich data sources. It will help enterprises step into a digital transformation and make decisions intelligently.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning-Enabled Business Intelligence For Dynamic Pricing Strategies In E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce makes dynamic pricing strategies an absolute necessity for businesses that want to maximise their earnings and keep a leading edge in their respective industries. This study was conducted with the intention of determining whether or not the application of machine learning (ML) and business intelligence (BI) could result in the development of dynamic pricing strategies that are more successful. Many companies have been unsuccessful because they relied on pricing techniques that had become obsolete as a result of the constantly shifting nature of the digital market. This study addresses the need for a more dynamic and data-driven pricing approach in online environments, thereby bridging a gap in the existing body of research on the topic. Although machine learning has been shown to be helpful in a variety of business contexts, its potential for dynamic pricing in online stores has not yet been completely explored through its integration with business intelligence. This is despite the fact that machine learning has been valuable in a number of business situations. The currently available research does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the synergies that can be achieved by combining ML and BI in pricing optimisation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), a machine learning technique, was selected as the primary tool for this study because of its ability to deal with intricate and nonlinear interactions included within enormous datasets. Combining technologies that are used for business intelligence in order to collect, process, and present important data results in the creation of a sophisticated framework that can be used to make decisions regarding pricing in real time. According to the findings, having a business intelligence system that is empowered with machine learning significantly improves a company's capacity to accurately price its products and services and to respond rapidly to changes in the market. Price decisions can be made that are both more precise and more sensitive to nuances thanks to the adaptability of the SVM model to changing market conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Web Application for Customer Segment based Black Friday Sales Forecast</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The study shows how factors internal to the sales forecasting process can introduce bias. Black Friday is upon us, and retailers everywhere stock up on inventory at dramatic discounts. The products aren't accessible to some clients due to poor arrangements, despite good sales. Managing a small staff and keeping potential customers in mind is more of a concern for shopkeepers. Despite some attempts at effective inventory management and sales forecast, the results have not been favorable. A prediction model has proven effective in managing this issue. By analyzing the previous spending patterns of clients, a precise and efficient algorithm can predict future spending. A variety of data analysis strategies, including regressors and classifiers, are employed to evaluate specificity and accuracy. Then, different algorithms are used to implement machine learning techniques. An extensive report of sales for Black Friday 2019 has been compiled. To calculate the volume, we took into account various factors, including age group, occupation, product category, city, etc. A store that wishes to predict sales could do so from this information. We have deployed our Flask-based user interface after determining which model is the best fit.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting Warehouse Location of Online Shopping Platforms with Machine Learning Algorithm – A Case Study</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online shopping has turned into the most convenient way to purchase products as it is more user friendly and the availability of the product is vast and also the range of products that the customers can select is abundant. Due to increasing customers in online shopping platforms, it is necessary for efficient warehouse location selection strategies to meet the increasing demand of the customers. By ensuring that all products are available and cutting down on delivery times, warehouse location optimization can improve customer satisfaction, which in turn boosts sales on e-commerce platforms. Using a dataset containing the required parameters, a Machine Learning algorithm can be deployed to optimize the warehouse location of virtual shopping platforms by analysing the total number of orders in each location. Various algorithms, such as KNN, SVM, and Random Forest algorithm, can be used to predict whether there is a need for a warehouse in a particular location. This study aims to determine which algorithm is best suited for this model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Graph Neural Network for Smartphone Recommendation System: A Sentiment Analysis Approach for Smartphone Rating</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The increasing demand for mobile phones has resulted in abundant online reviews, making it challenging for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. In this study, we propose Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to classify mobile phone ratings using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features. We collected a dataset of over 13,000 mobile phone evaluations from the Flipkart website. The proposed method includes data purification, balancing, feature extraction from the TF-IDF, and model prediction using deep learning models. The proposed approach utilized other models such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM to compare other classifiers. The experiments’ outcomes demonstrate that the suggested model performs better than conventional deep learning methods regarding accuracy and efficiency. The GNN model achieved the best 99.0% accuracy rate. The proposed approach can help consumers make informed purchasing decisions and can be extended to other e-commerce platforms with large datasets of online reviews.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multimodal Deep Neural Framework with Bayesian Optimization for Real-Time E-Commerce user Purchase Behaviour Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper introduces a neural network-based method for e-commerce user purchase behaviour prediction, solving the essential problem of personalized recommendation systems. By taking advantage of deep learning architectures, we propose a model that combines multimodal data such as user interactions, product features, and temporal patterns to predict purchase intent with high accuracy. Our developed Deep Neural Network (DNN) performs better than baseline algorithms, with 94.8% accuracy, 95.5% recall, and 94.8% F1-score, showing better capability to identify intricate behavioural patterns. Major innovations are featuring engineering optimized, batch normalization for stable training, and dropout regularization to avoid overfitting. Comparative evaluation against Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Transformer models validates the DNN's better performance, especially in dealing with sparse and high-dimensional data. The interpretability of the model is enhanced using attention mechanisms, exposing powerful drivers of purchases. Real-world applications involve real-time recommendation systems and targeted marketing, substantially increasing conversion rates. This study highlights the promise of neural networks in revolutionizing e-commerce analytics, providing scalable solutions to dynamic user behaviour prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting Best-Selling New Products in a Major Promotion Campaign Through Graph Convolutional Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Many e-commerce platforms, such as AliExpress, run major promotion campaigns regularly. Before such a promotion, it is important to predict potential best sellers and their respective sales volumes so that the platform can arrange their supply chains and logistics accordingly. For items with a sufficiently long sales history, accurate sales forecast can be achieved through the traditional statistical forecasting techniques. Accurately predicting the sales volume of a new item, however, is rather challenging with existing methods; time series models tend to overfit due to the very limited historical sales records of the new item, whereas models that do not utilize historical information often fail to make accurate predictions, due to the lack of strong indicators of sales volume among the item’s basic attributes. This article presents the solution deployed at Alibaba in 2019, which had been used in production to prepare for its annual “Double 11” promotion event whose total sales amount exceeded U.S. \ $ 38 billion in a single day. The main idea of the proposed solution is to predict the sales volume of each new item through its connections with older products with sufficiently long sales history. In other words, our solution considers the cross-selling effects between different products, which has been largely neglected in previous methods. Specifically, the proposed solution first constructs an item graph, in which each new item is connected to relevant older items. Then, a novel multitask graph convolutional neural network (GCN) is trained by a multiobjective optimization-based gradient surgery technique to predict the expected sales volumes of new items. The designs of both the item graph and the GCN exploit the fact that we only need to perform accurate sales forecasts for potential best-selling items in a major promotion, which helps reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments on both proprietary AliExpress data and a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves consistent performance gains compared to existing methods for sales forecast.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Online Buying Behaviour in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online buying behavior has undergone substantial shifts as a result of e-commerce, which has transformed the way consumers shop. Online buying is a common option for people looking to buy products and services while relaxing in their homes because of how simple it is. E-commerce as a result has a significant impact on how people shop online. E-commerce impacts online purchasing behavior in a variety of ways, including the availability of information, convenience, affordability, and usability. E-commerce has consequently become a well-liked option for customers looking to make purchases online. However, the development of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the e-commerce sector has had a big impact on consumers' online purchasing habits. With the aid of its tools, artificial intelligence analyses massive amounts of data, enhances search results, personalizes recommendations, and makes voice and visual search possible. As AI develops and becomes more sophisticated, it will have a bigger impact on how consumers behave when making purchases online. As a result, the current study proposed to investigate the impact of AI on buying behavior in the e-commerce sector. The study examines both the positive and negative effects of AI on consumers' online purchasing decisions. The study is conceptual in nature and collects data from secondary sources, such as books, reports, websites, newspapers, journals, and theses. Research practitioners and industries will benefit from the practical implications of current research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Application of a Deep Learning Algorithm With Integrated Attention Mechanism in Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Product Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>with the rapid development of e-commerce, product reviews have become an important channel for consumers to express their opinions and share experiences, and also an important reference for consumers and enterprises to make decisions. Therefore, it is very important to analyze the emotional tendency of product reviews. The purpose of this study is to improve the predictive performance of sentiment analysis of product reviews through deep learning algorithm and attention mechanism. The main tasks of this research are as follows: 1) the literature related to sentiment analysis based on sentiment dictionary, machine learning and deep learning algorithm is studied, and the goal and core technology of this research are defined; 2) text preprocessing of product reviews, including data denoising, word segmentation and stopping word removal, is carried out to ensure data quality, and text vectorization technology is used to convert text into numerical features; 3) convolutional neural network (CNN) + Bi-directional Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) model is constructed, and the Attention mechanism is integrated into it to form the CNN + Bi-LSTM + Attention model. By comparing the performance of the two models, it is found that the model with attention mechanism performs better in emotion classification task, with an accuracy of 94.13 %, which indicates that the attention mechanism can effectively enhance the ability of the model to capture key emotional information; 4) in order to further verify the superiority of the model, confusion matrix and ROC curve were used as evaluation tools in the study, and the results also proved that the model with the addition of attention mechanism performed better. The problem of data imbalance was encountered in the research process, but it was successfully solved by reasonable text preprocessing operations. This study not only validates the effectiveness of the deep learning model integrating attention mechanism in sentiment analysis of commodity reviews, but also provides new ideas and technical paths for solving specific problems in sentiment analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Review Rating Predictions Using Improved Deep Learning Architecture</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Understanding consumer sentiment has always been an important aspect of decision-making processes in e-commerce and service industries, therefore review rating prediction plays an important role in assessing it. Users' experiences are enhanced through accurate models that predict ratings reliably from reviews and feedbacks about products and services. This paper presents a novel hybrid deep learning-based model using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to address the task of review rating prediction. By utilizing Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) embeddings and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), our model can effectively capture both local patterns and sequential relationships of the text data. Experimental results on the Amazon 5-core software review dataset demonstrate that the proposed model attains 84.31% accuracy with TF- IDF, performing better than deep learning-based models. The proposed model demonstrates high recall, precision, and F1 scores, indicating the suitability of the proposed model for rating prediction. In addition, confidence interval tests justify the statistical reliability of the predictions achieved by the proposed model in producing a very low error rate and small error margin. This demonstrates the ability of the model to enhance the prediction of review ratings.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Application of Personalized Recommendation System Driven by Artificial Intelligence on E-commerce Platforms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rise and development of Internet technology, advanced technologies, including cloud computing and big data, have greatly enriched data processing and information access. However, the field of e-commerce faces the serious challenge of &quot;information overload&quot;. To solve this problem, this study designs and implements a personalised recommendation system based on artificial intelligence technology. The system integrates data mining and machine learning algorithms, accurately analyses users' purchase records, browsing history and preference characteristics, and intelligently predicts and recommends products that users may be interested in through complex algorithmic models. Experimental results show that the system is significantly better than the traditional recommendation system in terms of recommendation accuracy and recall rate, reaching 0.912 and 0.923 respectively, effectively improving the user experience. This result not only provides a new idea for e-commerce personalised recommendation, but also opens up a new path for the application of AI technology in the field of information filtering and recommendation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sales Forecast for Amazon Sales with Time Series Modeling</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Accurate sales prediction plays an important role in reducing costs and improving customer service levels, especially for B2C(Business to consumer) e-commerce. This paper attempts to forecast future sales at Amazon.com, Inc. based on historical sales data. Firstly, it proposes three possible forecasting approaches according to the historical data pattern, that is Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, neural network auto regression model and ARIMA(Autoregressive integrated moving average). Secondly, it specifies certain accuracy measures using which well determine the suitability of the forecast methods on the available sales data. Finally the three methods will be implemented to forecast Amazons quarterly sales in 2019. The results can help Amazon well manage its future operations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Customer Purchase Intent Prediction using Feature Aggregation on E-Commerce Clickstream Data</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a machine learning model for predicting customer purchase intent using e-commerce clickstream data. The model is built using the LightGBM framework, chosen for its efficiency in handling large-scale datasets and complex feature interactions. Key challenges addressed include the high dimensionality of clickstream data, the inherent class imbalance between purchase and non-purchase sessions, and the temporal variability of user behavior. The feature engineering process involved creating and selecting features that capture relevant user behaviors, such as session duration, event counts, and interaction diversity. The model was evaluated using ROC-AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall metrics, demonstrating strong performance in identifying sessions likely to result in a purchase. This study contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by providing a robust framework for conversion prediction, enabling more effective customer engagement strategies. Our findings underscore the potential of machine learning to enhance e-commerce conversion rates, thereby optimizing customer engagement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Convolutional Neural Network for Nigerian Traditional Male Attire Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online business has brought about tremendous positive change globally; however, it comes with some challenges. Thousands of different products are posted on a daily basis. Thus, automatic tagging and classification are becoming extremely important for business environment. In effort to aid with classification problems, this paper finds a CNN structure with the minimal computational expense to classify male attires for three main ethnic groups in Nigeria; Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa, while keeping prediction accuracy high. We tested several manually developed network structures and compared their accuracy with popular image classification networks, namely AlexNet. We collected a dataset of 1000 pictures, in 4 different classes. We achieved 72% of test accuracy on the shallow network built from scratch, performing better than AlexNet. The preliminary study shows that with proper image processing, a shallow network can be used for prediction, thus saving huge computational expense.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sales Prediction based on Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the increasing influence of the Internet on people’s life, the development of e-commerce platforms is more rapid, with users and earnings of these platforms showing a growing trend. In recent years, the strong support of national policies has also provided a good environment for the development of the e-commerce industry. Under the impact of the epidemic this year, the role of the e-commerce industry in the development of the national economy has become more prominent. In such cases, the number and the competitiveness of e-commerce platforms and e-commerce enterprises are increasing. If a platform wants to maintain its advantage in the competition, it must be able to better meet the needs of users, and do a good job in all aspects of coordination and management. At this point, the accurate forecast of the sales volume of e-commerce platforms is particularly important. At present, there are many studies on e-commerce sales prediction, but we are still exploring the prediction model that can be better applied in different scenarios. In this paper, we try and evaluate two linear models, three machine learning models and two deep learning models, finding that machine learning and deep learning models have no advantage in improving the accuracy of sales forecast, but on a predictive basis, models perform better when they include information on calendar and price.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Intelligent Chatbot Haggling with Ensemble ML Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years online shopping has gained a huge boom. With this increase, most of the features of online shopping are developed but some features like negotiating with shopkeepers are not available which is sometimes possible in offline purchasing. In this paper we have proposed a Chatbot to conduct product negotiations. Customers can interact with the Chatbot to receive help obtaining a fair price for a product (s). With such a system, which has an impact on key aspects of online buying, there is a chance that the budget of the customer or the product seller could be compromised. To avoid such situations, we have developed an algorithm in Machine learning which works along with prediction of old available data to provide a product price. Sometimes, price prediction is less accurate because some algorithms are inappropriate for a given dataset or because irrelevant features or properties of the data are employed. Due to the potential financial losses associated with even one incorrect price prediction, Ecommerce businesses do not only rely on price prediction systems. Some models also fail when data scales or some feature is unavailable after time on which model prediction was dependent. Our model's accuracy and dependability are maintained by managing these modifications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Applying Ensemble Learning with Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict the Reliability of Wafer-Level Packaging</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Before being introduced to the marketplace, electronic packaging products typically undergo an Accelerated Thermal Cycling (ATC) test. During the design phase, extensive repetitive experiments can lead to significant waste of both time and resources. Therefore, applying machine learning with finite element analysis to predict the reliability of advanced packaging can greatly enhance the efficiency of electronic packaging product development. To reduce costs, the validated finite element models will replace real experiments to generate a small dataset for training the machine learning models. The smaller the required dataset, the lower the time cost for simulation; however, this also increases the difficulty of training the high-performance machine learning models. To address challenges associated with training on small datasets, this study uses Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) as an example and applies ensemble learning with multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the reliability for packaging.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Hierarchical Bipartite Graph Neural Networks: Towards Large-Scale E-commerce Applications</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The e-commerce appeals to a multitude of online shoppers by providing personalized experiences and becomes indispensable in our daily life. Accurately predicting user preference and making a recommendation of favorable items plays a crucial role in improving several key tasks such as Click Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) in order to increase commercial value. Some state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods exploiting non-linear interactions on a user-item bipartite graph are able to learn better user and item representations with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs because they are inherently flat. Hierarchical representation is reportedly favorable in making more personalized item recommendations in terms of behaviorally similar users in the same community and a context of topic-driven taxonomy. However, some advanced approaches, in this regard, are either only considering linear interactions, or adopting single-level community, or computationally expensive. To address these problems, we propose a novel method with Hierarchical bipartite Graph Neural Network (HiGNN) to handle large-scale e-commerce tasks. By stacking multiple GNN modules and using a deterministic clustering algorithm alternately, HiGNN is able to efficiently obtain hierarchical user and item embeddings simultaneously, and effectively predict user preferences on a larger scale. Extensive experiments on some real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that HiGNN achieves a significant improvement compared to several popular methods. Moreover, we deploy HiGNN in Taobao, one of the largest e-commerces with hundreds of million users and items, for a series of large-scale prediction tasks of item recommendations. The results also illustrate that HiGNN is arguably promising and scalable in real-world applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Application of AI and ML in Industry 4.0</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summary The emergence of Industry 4.0 marks a transformative alternative in commercial practices pushed through the convergence of cyber‐physical structures, the Internet of Things (IoT), and superior computing technology. Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are at the core of this commercial revolution, playing a pivotal role in making production techniques extra green, productive, and innovative. This chapter explores the huge variety of packages of AI and ML within the Industry 4.0 paradigm and explains their effect on diverse components which include predictive upkeep, great management, deliver chain optimization, and the improvement of self‐reliant structures. Predictive upkeep makes use of AI and ML algorithms to investigate records from gadget sensors and expect gadget disasters earlier than they occur. This not only minimizes downtime but also reduces upkeep expenses and extends the carrier existence of the gadget. Quality management makes use of AI‐powered imaginative and prescient structures and ML fashions to discover defects and anomalies in real time, ensuring better product requirements and lowering waste. Additionally, AI and ML facilitate delivery chain optimization by reading big quantities of records to expect demand, manipulate inventory, and optimize logistics. This technology permits organizations to reply quickly to marketplace changes, enhancing operational agility and patron satisfaction. Another key application, self‐reliant operations, is seeing the combination of AI and ML in robotics and clever factories, permitting machines and structures to self‐organize and adapt to special manufacturing wishes without human intervention. The integration of AI and ML in Industry 4.0 additionally enables the introduction of virtual twins (digital replicas of bodily assets) that allow superior simulation, monitoring, and optimization of techniques. These virtual representations enhance decision‐making and operational performance by presenting a deep perception of the device's overall performance and ability issues. This evaluation highlights the transformative effect of AI and ML on Industry 4.0 and emphasizes their position in riding shrewd production, shrewd automation, and human empowerment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Study for the Prediction of E-Commerce Business Market Growth using Machine Learning Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Learning is a key to perform ideas adequately. Machine Learning empowers IT organizations to identify the patterns on the basis of currently available algorithms and data frames to cultivate acceptable solution concepts. Online business market and customer retention is a relation like the two sides of a coin. It is a nonlinear relationship. Prediction of Business growth is a very sensitive issue of E-Commerce market with its future existence. Online venders of business market manage their inventories on virtual prediction bases for full filling the basic need of demand-supply chain of customers. Authorizing traditional ways and analysis methods are not ensuring the rate of reliability of the sales prediction. To produce more precise predictions and analysis, we use ML algorithm. In this paper, we utilized the selling data set of an E-commerce company and segregated it, in different quarters then calculating the sale income per quarter. After that we divided the dataset in the proportion of 70% and 30% for Training data set and Testing data set. By applying machine learning algorithm, we will be predicting income of next quarters as well as analysis the maximally sold commodities with their frequencies of purchase per quarter. Then provide analysis results and prediction of customer's purchase patterns to the business organization to make a strategy to take a competitive advantage by sustaining and accumulating for their goods management and planning for inventories.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Marketing improvement in a Chilean Retail Company using Uplift Modeling with neural networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Marketing is a strategy that every company must implement today within its global plan both due to the need for external projection and for the achievement of commercial objectives. Currently, personalized marketing is key to the development of a company since it allows a better interaction with potential customers and the margin of loss or error in the direction of promotional campaigns is greatly reduced. One possibility to improve personalized marketing is the prediction of the effectiveness of campaigns to transform users into customers using artificial intelligence, so it is necessary to develop models that allow identifying profiles or segments of people who are more willing to answer positively to a campaign. This task corresponds to uplift modeling that predicts the incremental impact of the application of treatments on a population, which is typically performed using classical models such as the one-model approach, the class transformation approach, and the two-model approach. In this work, the use of multilayer neural networks is proposed to perform uplift modeling in a Chilean online retail company. The results of the proposed model as well as classical uplift modeling techniques are presented. These results indicate that the neuronal model allows an increase of more than 30 % in relation to the area of the Qini curve, while it is competitive in other metrics. As future work, it is planned to model a Siamese neural network with the cost function of uplift modeling directly.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Warehouse Volume Forecasting and Warehouse Segmentation Strategy Based on Time Series and Machine Learning Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the booming development of e-commerce, the competition of e-commerce enterprises has intensified, and accurate demand forecasting and reasonable inventory strategy have become the key to improve core competitiveness. In this paper, we focus on e-commerce warehousing, construct ARIMA, decision tree and LSTM models to predict the inventory and daily sales of 350 categories in the next three months, and select the optimal prediction model for each category based on the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to lay a data foundation for warehousing allocation. Then, the target planning models of “one warehouse for one product” and “multiple warehouses for one product” are constructed respectively, and solved by genetic algorithms, taking into full consideration of the warehouse rental cost, warehouse capacity and capacity utilisation rate, category relevance and other factors, to arrive at the corresponding optimal warehousing scheme. These solutions help e-commerce enterprises to optimise the allocation of warehouse resources, reduce operating costs and improve warehouse management efficiency while meeting market demand.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Comparative Study of Deep Learning and Machine Learning Algorithm for Sentiment Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Sentiment analysis is a classification procedure where we apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyze the sentiment of the dataset, which consists of text, e.g., a message that can be of positive or negative sentiment. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate which sentiment analysis techniques are feasible for product reviews. Here, the Amazon reviews dataset is used to compare, train, and test various machine learning and deep learning methods having product reviews from Amazon, which are chosen randomly from an open-source repository. The dataset comprises 4 million reviews. Comparison of several algorithms' performances, i.e., RFC, XGBC, LGBM, MNB, GBC, DTC, and Bi-LSTM, amongst which Bi-LSTM gives the highest performance among the algorithms used for classification. It was also applied to the other reviews from the Amazon dataset to predict the sentiment of the reviews, as well as a fresh Amazon scraped dataset comprising product reviews from several categories. This resulted in a very accurate classification, with the best results for test reviews on the amazon dataset. In conclusion, Bi-LSTM networks are excellent for categorizing customer sentiment on product reviews, and the results do not differ considerably across categories.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Forecast the Rating of Online Products from Customer Text Review based on Machine Learning Algorithms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>An online product's rating is an essential metric to understand the acceptability of that product to users. Shoppers use the rating to measure the quality and excellence of the online product. It helps an online shopper to decide to buy a product or not. It also helps the producer to further modification of that product during reproduction. Sometimes people buy a product online and give a text review of buying products but apathy towards giving a number rating, commonly a star rating. But producers need to know the rating of products for analysis of their business. Producers can use this rating for business analysis and can drive better revenue to their business. We have used some supervised machine learning approach to predict rating based on customer text review and compared the results between Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost and Logistic Regression algorithm with TF-IDF Vectorizer from extensive and series of experiments. We applied the algorithms mentioned above on the dataset named “GrammarandProductReviews” provided by Datafiniti. We analyzed the performance of each algorithm through the accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. From the study, it is observed that Random Forest algorithm gained accuracy of 94% and precision, recall and f1-scores are 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94 respectively, which showed best compared to others.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Sparse Data Performance in E-Commerce Dynamic Pricing with Reinforcement Learning and Pre-Trained Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based framework designed to tackle dynamic pricing challenges in e-commerce. Prior research has predominantly concentrated on algorithm selection to enhance performance in dense data scenarios. However, many of these models fail to robustly address sparse data structures, such as low-traffic products, leading to the ‘cold-start’ problem [4]. Through numerical analysis, our framework offers innovative insights derived from the design of the reward function and integrates product clustering with pre-trained learning to mitigate this issue. As a result of this optimization, the performance of predictive models on sparse data is expected to see substantial improvement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Novel Multi-Class Product Rating Prediction Model based on Enhanced Textrank Text Encoding and Human Psychology Simulation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, with the booming development of the internet and e-commerce, user comments and ratings on a particular product often determine the marketing strategies of businesses. It is believed that if businesses can collect user feedback (such as through surveys) before they rate a product, they can analyze people's product experiences at minimal cost. However, most comments are in free-form, slang, or internet language, and manually categorizing and annotating them would require significant resources, which is not feasible for small and medium -sized businesses. To address this issue, some deep learning frameworks have been used for sentiment analysis and rating prediction in text. However, these models often overlook the actual application scenario when predicting ratings. In reality, users' ratings are not solely based on their own experiences but are also influenced by the historical comments on the product. Therefore, we propose a supervised product rating prediction model. In the first stage, the improved dynamic TextRank submodule (DTsub) and a lightweight Feature Fusion submodule (FFsub) are used to construct text vectors, utilizing a sentiment word library. In the second stage, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and a Feed Forward neural network (FFNN) are utilized to predict product ratings (multiclass) based on the actual application scenario using ensemble learning and voting. Additionally, we also introduced a weighted cross-entropy loss tailored to businesses product ratings in our model. Experimental results on an Amazon product review dataset show significant improvements in accuracy, F1 score, and F2 score of our proposed DTFS-LFNN model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Location-Aware Graph Neural Network Supported Session Recommendation Algorithm for e-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To address the problems of low recommendation efficiency and low accuracy in session recommendation in e-commerce platforms, the study accomplishes session recommendation in e-commerce by constructing Position-Aware Graph Neural Networks (PA-GNN). The model combines location information with the embedding of nodes based on the construction of location-aware graphs, aggregates different location features and neighborhood features, and achieves the prediction of product preferences in e-commerce based on short-term preferences and long-term preferences. For the effect of location information on recommendation performance, the range of P@20, MAP, MRR, and AP improvement ratios for PA-GNN model is 10.23-15.26%, 9.89-14.23%, 8.16-12.63%, and 6.35-11.20%. For the PA-GNN model, the recommendation performance of the Tmall dataset is stronger than that of the Yoochoose dataset in the baseline algorithm, location information, and long- and short-term interest preference comparison experiments. The conversation recommendation model constructed in the study has ideal recommendation performance in different e-commerce datasets and can be widely used in conversation recommendation systems, knowledge graphs, etc.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An AI-based Forecasting Model for Intelligent Pick Face Replenishment</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>An array of new opportunities and challenges for logistics businesses has been brought e-commerce. Moreover, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are becoming the norm around the world. However, most logistics industries in Hong Kong, especially small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs), lack the industrialization. Therefore, logistics service providers (LSPs) should exchange information and plan their operation effectively, which allows LSPs to maintain and develop their e-commerce logistics business with greater success. This paper develops an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based e-fulfilment forecasting model which integrates demand forecasting and pick face strategy to enhance the order-picking efficiency of LSPs. Thereby, prompt assistance for operational decision-making as the AI would enable the logistics industry to predict dynamic e-commerce order demand and optimize operational efficiency by providing suggestions for pick face strategies. With the aid of the proposed forecasting model, LSPs can handle fluctuating e-orders without renovating and rebuild the whole premises and infrastructure through the generated optimal pick face replenishment strategy and fully utilize resources. Thus, sustainability in warehouse operations capabilities can be achieved to accomplish the SDGs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting License Plate Prices using Machine and Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, the implementation of predicting license plate prices using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques is described. We focus on Dubai's license plates, given that they are not uniformly priced and the said variations in price can be attributed to specific patterns within the plates. The ML and DL techniques used in this work create models that could accurately predict the price of a plate from its content. We believe that this could lead to the deployment of a web application that would allow the potential buyers or sellers of a plate to easily gauge the inherent market price.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>When to Message: Investigating User Response Prediction with Machine Learning for Advertisement Emails</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Direct marketing message campaigns are a common way for businesses to deliver updates, recommendations, or coupons to their user base to spark interest in brands and products. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using machine learning to predict the response behavior of users to regular newsletter emails from a real-world e-commerce business. In doing so, we train and evaluate classification models, such as random forests and artificial neural networks, to predict the probability of a user interacting with an email based on past behavior. Further investigation is conducted into the potential of using the sending time of a message to influence responses, based on the assumption that a user’s likeliness to be engaged depends on the time of day a message is received. We identify two user groups that have a preference regarding morning and evening messages and can show that this preference holds for a subsequent message campaign. Thus, our results demonstrate a clear potential for time-aware response modeling approaches for marketing campaigns.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Autonomous Supermarket Robot Assistance using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>People shop in Supermarkets to examine the quality of a product physically before purchasing them. But when it comes to locating their desired products where they can't rely on staffs, pushing the loaded carts around the market and standing in queues for billing, especially for elderly customers and the disabled, it must be quite an unpleasant shopping experience and time consuming. To overcome these issues, in this paper we provide a novel solution for a better and smart shopping experience by designing an Autonomous Supermarket Robot. It can guide the customers through the repository of various products to the desired one and can be switched over to an Autonomous trolley to carry the purchased products. After the purchase, a load cell and a camera are used to predict the purchased product through Deep learning using Convolution neural networks and finally the customers can pay through their bank account. These technologies work on a common framework and provide a promising potential for robot assistance in supermarkets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Convolutional Neural Network Model to Detect Illegitimate URLs</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The internet has become a global means of communication in all aspects of our lives. Using the internet for social activities, financial transactions, e-banking and shopping have become simple and safe to a high extent. Global online retail business is growing dramatically every year. On the other side, illegitimate fraud websites have been growing exponentially due to the increased number of e-businesses and internet users, hence, the plethora of fraud detection systems. Fraudsters always try to trap internet users to collect and steal their sensitive information using tricky techniques. Phishing is one way to trick internet users and direct them to access false Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) in an attempt to steal usernames, passwords and credit cards details. Discovering an intelligent way to determine false websites from true ones is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN-1D) model to detect illegitimate URLs. To evaluate the performance of the model, we carried out few experiments using a benchmarked dataset. We used two evaluation measures: accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The proposed CNN-1D model was able to achieve good performance for predicting the unseen URLs and detecting illegitimate websites. In the testing phase, the classifier achieved an accuracy rate of 94.31% and an overall performance (AUC) rate of 91.23%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Construction of an Intelligent E-Commerce Big Data Analysis System Based on Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Background: In the context of rapid development of e-commerce, how to maximise the potential of big data to optimise user interactions and improve service quality has become a key point of research. This study proposes a concept of an intelligent e-commerce big data analytics system based on deep learning, which deeply mines e-commerce data covering multiple dimensions such as user behavioural trajectories, product details, and transaction history, aiming to achieve fine-grained product recommendation algorithms, customized marketing solutions, and optimized inventory control processes. Method: The system relies on a distributed architecture to enhance its processing performance on massive datasets and ensure that it can provide immediate analytical feedback. We employ a variety of deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variant Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) for sequential data processing, and Transformer models for natural language processing tasks. Results: The experimental data proves that the system demonstrates significant competitive advantages over traditional solutions in terms of increased user satisfaction and improved sales performance. The system achieved 95% accuracy in the product image classification task, 0.15 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the user behaviour sequence prediction task, and 88% accuracy in the online review sentiment analysis task. Conclusion: The innovation of this research is to provide a novel deep learning architecture for big data parsing in e-commerce, which points to new paths for future exploration in academia and industry. In addition, the paper proposes corresponding countermeasures for the challenges that may be encountered during system deployment, providing e-commerce enterprises with data-driven decision support to help them make smarter strategic choices in the competitive marketplace.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Analysis on a New Machine Learning-Based Artificial Neural Network Technique for Natural Gas Price Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>People use natural gas widely since it is the cleanest energy source. As the world's population grows, natural gas is becoming one of the most important energy sources. It is suggested as one of the ways to increase global environmental pollution reduction and energy production protection. Not only is it the most fuel for civilian employ, but it is moreover an essential component for many mechanical applications and the production of electricity. Because of its important natural advantages, natural gas is becoming more and more important to the future of global vitality, making research and price forecasting imperative. In competitive normal gas marketplaces, the ability to estimate characteristic gas costs has proven to be a highly valuable tool for all showcase members due to its various benefits. Machine learning algorithms have led to the development of widely used tools for estimating common gas costs. The purpose of this project is to investigate data-driven predictive models based on popular ML methods, such as ANN, for common gas cost estimation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Revolutionizing MSME Operations with DSILN</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In emerging economies, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the economic backbone, yet they continue to suffer from inept in inventory management, demand forecasting, and logistics coordination, especially in rural and semi-urban setups. Centralized systems seldom provide these businesses with the on-demand flexibility, transparency, and real-time capabilities they require. Here is where the paper innovatively puts forth DSILN (Decentralized Smart Inventory and Logistics Network), a novel concept integrating blockchain, AI, and community logistics. DSILN provides a decentralized inventory ledger via Hyperledger Fabric for an inventory tracking system that is transparent and tamper-proof, with an AI engine that provides demand forecasting on the fly and peer-to-peer inventory matching, plus a logistics coordination layer that maximizes last-mile delivery using local transport capacities and intelligent routing algorithms. The system tries to remove inefficiencies from the traditional supply chains and foster MSME collaborative commerce. DSILN lends to enhanced forecasting accuracy, lower inventory mismatches, reduced delivery cost, and greater supply chain resilience, as shown through simulation-based validation and benchmarking against established literature.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Commodity Price Prediction for making informed Decisions while trading using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Commodity markets are physical or virtual marketplaces where market players meet to buy or sell positions in commodities such as crude oil, gold, copper, silver, cotton, and wheat. People invest their hard-earned money based on some predictions to gain some profit from commodity market. Although, traditional methods such as technical analysis &amp; fundamental analysis are very popular among traders, they are not as accurate as analysis by long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. In this paper, we have developed a model of well-known efficient LSTM algorithm to predict the commodity market price by utilizing a freely accessible dataset for commodity markets having open, high, low, and closing prices from historical data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Flat-Hierarchical Approach Based on Machine Learning Model for e-Commerce Product Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Within the e-commerce sphere, optimizing the product classification process assumes pivotal importance, owing to its direct influence on operational efficiency and profitability. In this context, employing machine learning algorithms stands out as a premier solution for effectively automating this process. The design of these models commonly adopts either a flat or local (hierarchical) approach. However, each of them exhibits significant limitations. The regional approach introduces taxonomic inconsistencies in predictions, whereas the flat approach becomes inefficient when dealing with extensive datasets featuring high granularity. Therefore, our research introduces a solution for hierarchical product classification based on a Machine Learning model that integrates flat and local (hierarchical) classification approaches using a 4-level electronic product dataset obtained from a renowned e-commerce platform in Latin America. In pursuit of this goal, a comparative analysis of seven machine learning algorithms, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classifier, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, FastText, and Voting Ensemble, was conducted. This hybrid approach model performs better than models using a single approach. It surpassed the top-performing flat approach model by 0.15% and outperformed the leading local approach (Local Classifier per Level) model by 4.88%, as measured by the weighted F1-score. Additionally, this paper contributes to the academic community by presenting a significant Spanish-language dataset comprising over one million products and discussing the preprocessing techniques tailored for the dataset. It also addresses the study’s inherent limitations and potential avenues for future exploration in this field.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multilevel Product Classification Using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Platforms for e-commerce commonly employ a preestablished, organized structure of product classifications. Traditional product categorization methods have primarily relied on text-based data, which can occasionally fall short of providing a comprehensive understanding of a product’s characteristics. However, employing image data in classification models has several advantages. The pictures offer a wealth of visual knowledge by capturing details such as color, shape, texture, and size that text explanations may miss. By incorporating text and image data, the classifier gains greater knowledge of each product, resulting in higher categorization reliability. Furthermore, the inclusion of image data enables the machine learning model to discover aesthetic patterns and features that are tricky to convey through text alone, expanding its ability to precisely assign items to their corresponding categories. The current study validates a new classifier for predicting categories using both textual and image data. This suggested approach is being attempted to enhance the accuracy and fullness of product classification.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning Insights for Predicting Customer Behavior in Online Retail</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The research work reports a comprehensive analysis of predictive analytics of customer behavior on e-commerce based on high-end data science and artificial intelligence techniques. The sourced information for customer demographics, transaction details, and purchase history was extracted from Kaggle. Machine learning models' applications were utilized to predict the attrition of the customers, which indicated that the accuracy of Random Forest was 87%, while that of XGBoost was 89%. The performance of the model was tested in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Precisely and recall for XGBoost were both 0.88. Additionally, different consumer types were identified by applying K-Means clustering to classify customers into different kinds based on their attributes of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary. Its findings indicate that predictive analytics can play a very significant input in making advertisements very effective and in keeping clients in this very dynamic world of e-commerce. In the last few years, there has been an impressive rise in online shopping due to more and more people gaining access to the internet, a growing preference for convenience, and technology's ever-changing nature of digital platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Review of Learning-Based E-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Now e-commerce applications based on learning are continuously improving our daily life. These learning methods include graph neural networks, deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. More and more researchers use these methods to solve many problems in ecommerce, such as shopping, fraud detection, and product recommendation. To help researchers gain progress in the field, we survey the state-of-art work on the topic in this paper. Specifically, we focus on learning-based methods in typical ecommerce tasks: customer service, fraud detection and antifraud, cross-border transactions, and commerce forecast. We brief these methods, compare their pros and cons, and raise some problems for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning Approach to Predict E-commerce Customer Satisfaction Score</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we investigate the performance of machine learning (ML) to predict customers' satisfaction score from the sales dataset collected by Olist, the Brazilian e-commerce company. Customer satisfaction score is categorized into 4 classes: Low, Average, Good and Excellent where majority of sales orders receive Excellent score. Inspired by the fact that delivery duration and product rating score obtained from other customers' purchase are one of the main factors that influence customer's satisfaction score, we propose a feature engineering method that creates delivery duration and the average product rating score which are used as the main features in the ML model. We employ Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) to predict customers' satisfaction score and their performance are compared with the baseline model which predicts the customer satisfaction score using the average product rating score. Results show that RF model yields the best performance with the average precision, recall, and macro F1 equal to 0.34, 0.36, and 0.32, respectively. In addition, RF achieves the best recall equal to 0.43, 0.33 and 0.33 for Low, Average and Good classes. The mean and SD of the product rating are two features with the highest feature importance equal to 0.313 and 0.087, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Effective Customer Segmentation Approach to Improve E-Commerce Platform Quality Based on Intensive Learning Methodology</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To accomplish company goals and reap advantages while satisfying and meeting consumer expectations, segmentation is an essential facilitator. Identifying subgroups of the target market that share common traits, requirements, and priorities is customer segmentation's primary goal. Various dataset dimensionalities are also considered, as are changes across time. In this study, we use time-based segmentation and clustering approaches to the e-commerce industry to conduct predictive neural network analysis using factors such as product reviews, goods, buying trend, watching pattern, and more. In this research, Intensive Neural Classification Learning (INCL) is presented as a novel deep learning technique. To assess its efficacy, it is cross-validated with the traditional Neural Network (NN) learning algorithm. We have evaluated unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as part of the feature extraction process and identified the unique brands per consumer. In addition, the customer's chosen brands may be determined using a neural network, and the projected data can then be utilized for statistical analysis. We all know that sentiment analysis and categorization are huge help when trying to guess how customers feel about certain companies and items. Lastly, using the provided set of input data, we will choose the top brands by assessing the accuracy of the forecasts.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Smart Agriculture for Crop Productive Using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The majority of India's GDP comes from farming activities, which accounts for a sizable amount of the country's economy. This initiative was inspired by the increasing number of farmers committing suicide, which may have been brought on by poor agricultural yields. There are several risks to the agriculture industry from climate change and other environmental variables, which makes farming more difficult and uncertain. Using historical data on soil composition, rainfall patterns, temperature fluctuations, and previous agricultural practices, our goal is to create reliable predictive models that can reliably estimate crop yields by utilising machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier for customers and farmers to conduct direct business, cutting out middlemen and enabling farmers to determine their own prices. Because of this change, farmers now have more control over the products they produce and how they engage with markets, which helps to create a more just and sustainable agricultural ecosystem. Our objective is to incorporate these developments into our prediction models, resulting in a complete solution that helps farmers navigate market dynamics and enhances their standard of living while simultaneously optimising crop yield forecasts.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimizing Discount Strategies Using Machine Learning / Deep Learning Models with RPA Tool</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Optimizing discount strategies using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models helps maximize sales while maintaining profitability and optimal discount rates. Unplanned discount strategies may not always yield the best results. In this study, a dataset was collected from Amazon using UiPath, a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool. The dataset includes television product details such as price, discount percentage, ratings, and other factors. Among ML models, Random Forest performed the best, achieving a 10-12 % improvement over Linear Regression and Decision Trees in terms of accuracy due to its ability to capture complex relationships in data. XGBoost showed slightly better performance than Random Forest, providing a 3-5 % improvement due to its gradient boosting mechanism. In DL models, the Transformer-based model outperformed MLP and LSTM, reducing the error by 15-20% compared to MLP and by 8-10% compared to LSTM. The Transformer model effectively captured dependencies in the dataset, making it the most accurate for predicting optimal discounts. The findings provide insights into the most effective pricing strategies that businesses can use to maximize revenue while maintaining profitability. The final output of this research is a data-driven recommendation system that suggests optimal discount rates for products to enhance sales while minimizing revenue loss.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Design and Comparison of Collaborative Filtering Technology for Product Suggestions in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce websites and internet purchasing have never been more necessary. Product recommendations are a key tactic employed by online buying platforms. This study compares two different filtering algorithms that are used in product recommendationson websites like Amazon and Flipkart. Reviews of electrical devices, user data, and timestamps were all gathered from Kaggle and put into a dataset. These specifics then undergo several preprocessing steps. The steps are data visualization, duplicate value analysis, missing value analysis, and datatype analysis. The exhibited data is then used to train and test the machine learning models. For this purpose, two machine learning models are developed using two different algorithms. The algorithms K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) and Support Vector Decomposition (SVD) are employed. The models are then trained to acquire used in the prediction procedure after that. The best models for the prediction process are then determined by scrutinizing the results of both models. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values are located and compared because the findings of the analysis weren't sufficient.The erroneous data are plotted into a graph and evaluated to further demonstrate the point. As the SVD method is discovered to be the best of the group, the algorithm's greatest and worst predictions are discovered and examined. Even the poorest model constructed for the study's predictions turned out to be superior to several other prediction algorithms used for product suggestions. This algorithm can be deployed into the backend of any e-commerce website making it more effective.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Influence of Artificial Intelligence Using Decision Making System in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-Commerce is one of the potential idea and network developments which influence the present business world. It spreads worldwide and reaches people rapidly due to its massive benefits and trading approach. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of the e-commerce industry, providing retailers with new and innovative ways to manage and grow their business. One of AI's key advantages is its capacity to offer tailored product recommendations based on user information including shopping patterns, search terms, and browsing habits. By using AI algorithms to analyze this data, retailers can offer customers relevant product recommendations that are more likely to result in a sale. Automating customer support is a further area where AI is useful. Chatbots that are driven by AI can offer all times, immediate service to customers, increasing their satisfaction and speeding up response times. Retailers may now streamline their customer care procedures and concentrate on other aspects of their businesses thanks to this. By forecasting demand, identifying popular products, and ensuring that the relevant products are in stock at the appropriate moment, AI can assist merchants in streamlining their inventory management procedures. Retailers can lower the risk of overstocking or understocking products, which can result in missed sales and lower profitability, by using AI to manage inventory. Furthermore, AI can be used for fraud detection by analyzing customer behavior, purchase history, and other data points. This helps retailers to prevent fraudulent transactions and reduce chargebacks, which can result in significant financial losses. Finally, by examining competition prices, demand, and other factors, AI can assist businesses in optimizing their pricing strategy. By setting the right price, retailers can maximize profits and increase sales. The Main objective of this work is, using advanced technologies to analyze the Ecommerce data and prediction of sales accurately. Different ML and DL algorithms using this work for E-Commerce analysis and Prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Learning Based Predictive Model to Capture Consumer Emotion from the Ecommerce Sector using Sentiment Analysis Technique</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Sentiment analysis has become a popular topic of research in the last several years, and a lot of work has already been done in this area, including sentiment analysis of product reviews on Amazon, Flipkart, and other platforms. Twitter is a multifaceted platform that spreads its wide-ranging dialogue across a variety of industries, such as consumer goods, politics, and education. One way to evaluate the enormous volume of views on Twitter is using sentiment analysis. Nonetheless, recent advancements in sentiment analysis techniques, particularly in relation to Recurrent Neural Networks, have shown a great deal of promise for raising the effectiveness and accuracy of sentiment analysis for Amazon product reviews. In recent years, sentiment analysis has grown in popularity as a tool for analysing product reviews on websites such as Amazon.com. The speed and accuracy of sentiment analysis for Amazon product evaluations have improved dramatically with the advancement of methodologies, particularly the use of Recurrent Neural Networks.

        <dc:title>Multi-Modal Colour Extraction Using Deep Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Multimodal learning research has advanced quickly over the past ten years in a variety of fields, especially computer vision. Due to the growing opportunities of multimodal streaming data and deep learning algorithms, deep multimodal learning is increasingly common. This calls for the development of models that can reliably handle and interpret the multimodal data. Unstructured real-world data, often known as modalities, can naturally assume many different shapes, including both text and images often. Deep learning researchers are still driven by the need to extract useful patterns from this type of data. It is crucial to have well-organized product catalogues to enhance customers' experiences as they explore the plethora of possibilities provided by online marketplaces. The availability of product characteristics like colour or material is a crucial component of it. However, attribute data is frequently erroneous or absent on several of the markets we focus on. Utilizing deep models that have been trained on huge corpora to predict features from unstructured data, such as product descriptions and photographs (referred to as modalities in this study), is one potential approach to solving this issue. To receive a comprehensive rundown of the various multi-modal colour extraction techniques and their advantages, drawbacks and open challenges.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Business Intelligence</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and explainable AI (XAI) techniques plays a crucial role in enhancing Business Intelligence (BI) systems. This study employs a mixed-methods approach, applying XAI-enhanced models to well-known BI tasks, namely, customer segmentation, demand forecasting, market basket analysis, and churn prediction using the Online Retail II dataset. The dataset preprocessing and feature engineering significantly improves model performance, while XAI methods such as SHAP, LIME, and PDP provided transparency, enhancing stakeholder trust and interpretability. The experimental results demonstrate that combining AI models with XAI techniques achieved both high predictive accuracy and interpretability, increasing model adoption rate, user satisfaction, and reducing time to insight. This study highlights the value of integrating AI with XAI in BI systems, providing a balanced approach to accurate predictions and transparency.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Intelligent Recommendation Method for Product Information of E-commerce Platform Based on Machine Learning Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product recommendation has become an important way to alleviate the overload of e-commerce shopping information. In order to provide personalized recommendations, the recommendation system will express users and items as user preference vectors and item feature vectors, respectively. Different dimensions in the item feature vector correspond to different features of the item. Each dimension in the user preference vector represents the user's preference for the corresponding dimension of the item. Currently, most recommendation algorithms assume that the preference vectors for different items and the same user are the same. However, in real life, this assumption is not tenable. Therefore, this article proposes a DARR model to solve the above problems, and compares it on the public recommendation dataset to verify the effectiveness of the model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Artificial Intelligence Systems for Warehouses Stocks Control</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents an image recognition methodology designed to manage warehouse inventory using artificial intelligence. The system is implemented with low-cost hardware, which makes it accessible to developers of such systems. The different types of warehouse management activities are presented, as warehouses are one of the most successfully developing sectors for the last 10 years worldwide. The process is also related to the growth of e-commerce, which leads to the natural process of constantly increasing the number of warehouses. Warehouses must meet a number of modern management conditions so that minimization of errors in deliveries to the end user is achieved and the preparation of shipments for delivery is as fast as possible. This methodology allows to build a large part of the activities in the warehouses, through autonomous systems using artificial intelligence running on low-cost resources.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Trust and Privacy in E-Commerce Platforms by Preventing DNS Heavyweight Attacks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce is the largest platform of online business that provides users with a virtual environment for interaction related to buying and selling tasks. People prefer to purchase online to have more variety of products and to get items at discounted prices. But data privacy is a big concern in such scenarios where the user is communicating with E-Commerce platforms using their personal and financial details. The attacker can easily target the user and breach the data/ information and login credentials of the user by cyberattacks like domain name system attacks. Ingenious solutions for the early identification of Domain Name assaults for various e-commerce platforms may now be available as machine learning solutions can be deployed in real network environments as well. The strategy proposed in this research paper serves as a protective barrier for the Ecommerce platforms to prevent the breaching the information. The methodology is suggested to employ a trained machine smart loader chip for attack detection to make sure that only allowed data packets are transmitted to the domain name system server of the e-commerce system. The dataset used to train and test artificial intelligence algorithms is derived from the data repository of the Canadian Institute for Cyber Security. According to the findings, the decision tree classifier is the most effective technique for spotting domain name system attack infections at an early stage.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunication, Medical Industry Using Machine Learning Classification Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting the number of customers leaving a company is important for companies operating in various sectors. Businesses can now employ predictive models to identify clients at risk of churning, thanks to the growing availability of data and developments in methodologies for machine learning. This abstract offers an overview of predicting customer churn and highlights the most important techniques and strategies used in this subject. The purpose of developing models for customer churn prediction is to properly estimate which customers are likely to end their connection with a company or stop utilising the goods or services offered by that firm. Businesses can execute targeted retention measures to reduce customer turnover and increase customer loyalty when customers likely to leave are identified in advance. Several different machine learning classification models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), have been used in the process of predicting customer turnover. To forecast future churn, these models uncover relevant patterns from previous customer data, such as demographics, transaction history, customer interactions, and use trends. The unique features of the industry that are being taken into account should guide the selection of the most appropriate model. Variations in data availability, client behaviour, and other industry-specific issues may need individualised strategies for various businesses, such as those in the medical field, the banking industry, the online retail sector, and the telecommunications sector. When evaluating the efficacy of churn prediction models, standard performance evaluation criteria include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. With these measures, companies can evaluate how successful their models are at accurately classifying customers as either churners or non-churners.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Study on Impact of Feature Selection on Product Valuation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce is emerging as the most favored retail destination. As more and more people are connecting to internet, the sales and revenue of online markets are increasing rapidly. In order to encourage more people to shop online e-commerce platforms set attracting offers on their products, offers which a common brick and mortar owner can never think off. To sell products in such low rates and also earn profits, online markets use machine learning algorithms to analyze their sales transactions and build better algorithms to predict prices and offers. In this paper transactional data is analyzed to discover features which influence offer value of products and then use different regression algorithms to predict better offer value for products.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Dynamic Retail Pricing via Q-Learning - A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Enhanced Revenue Management</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study examines how a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, utilizing the Q-Learning algorithm, can improve dynamic pricing techniques in retail. Contrary to conventional pricing methodologies, which often depend on fixed demand assumptions, our RL-based strategy adapts continuously to changing market situations, thereby providing a more adaptable and responsive pricing mechanism. By constructing a simulated retail environment, we show how RL efficiently tackles real-time shifts in consumer behavior and market conditions, resulting in superior revenue performance. Our findings highlight not only the RL model's ability to outperform traditional methods in revenue generation, but also its capacity to reveal intricate relationships between price sensitivity and demand. This research demonstrates the significant promise of artificial intelligence-driven approaches to economic decision-making, and it outlines how more advanced, data-focused pricing strategies can be used across varied commercial fields.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Fake Review Detection Of E-Commerce Electronic Products Using Machine Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid growth of internet access has given rise to a digital era. The availability of internet access has pushed almost 70% of the population to switch to internet for their daily needs and accessories. Mainly, E-commerce platforms are being used at a much higher rate than ever before. People who buy from these e-commerce platforms make decisions on whether to buy a product or not solely based on the ratings and reviews of a product that are provided by these platforms. Due to the simple nature of this review system, sellers and even individuals tend to exploit it by writing dishonest reviews with an intention of either boosting its ratings or simply to sabotage it. These fake reviews are aimed at deceiving customers and convince them to buy/deter a certain product. Due to the lack of a robust system to identify real and fake reviews, these spams manage to show up on top. To avoid this problem and provide a more efficient way to filter and provide a more efficient way to reviews. This work focus on designing machine learning model for fake review detection and compare the performance of three different algorithms. As a result of this research work random forest algorithm outperform than other two algorithms. Web based User Interface(UI) designed to remove fake review and display trusted review based on the ranking.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on Emergency Transportation and Structural Optimization of E-commerce Logistics Network for Goods Volume Prediction and Optimal Scheduling</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper explores how to reduce costs and improve efficiency by predicting the package volume at various logistics sites and railways, and arranging transportation and sorting plans in advance. We have established prediction models, optimization models, evaluation models, and conducted in-depth research on emergency transportation and network optimization. The main work of this paper is divided into four aspects. Firstly, data cleaning and prediction using ARIMA and LSTM models; secondly, constructing a cargo distribution optimization model based on the DC5 diversion ratio and solving it using simulated annealing algorithm; thirdly, constructing a flow plan planning model based on three-objective dynamic decision-making and solving it using simulated annealing algorithm. Fourthly, the indicators for evaluating the impact of routes include the number of transported packages, transportation frequency, maximum transportation volume, and transportation balance; for site influence factors, we choose the total amount of goods sent and the number of goods received by the site. We have built a comprehensive evaluation model for site routes based on entropy weight Topsis and conducted five comparative experiments to verify the robustness of the model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Forecasting</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summary This chapter begins with somewhat technical discussions of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including neural networks, with examples of their application in online retail and energy. DL offers an alternative to complex forecasting pipelines. With DL, only a limited amount of data preprocessing is necessary and feature engineering is included in the DL model itself. ML and hybrid modeling strategies have emerged as top contenders in time series forecasting because of the volume of data and processing power brought about by the information age. The trend toward more effective medicine will continue exploiting information from genomics while utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to improve diagnostics, discover more effective drugs, and reduce preventable medical errors, now the third‐highest cause of death. The chapter ends with a recap of findings from the M4 competition – the key takeaways for practitioners. A key component of forecasting AI performance is forecasting computational power.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Quantum Neural Networks driven Stochastic Resource Optimization for Metaverse Data Marketplace</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Metaverse can unleash the potentials of Internet of Sense (IoS) communication by intertwining objects and environment between physical world and parallel virtual world. In order to digitally experience smell or taste and navigate effortlessly in virtual reality, optimal resource allocation to strengthen sensing data based infrastructure system is a critical research challenge. The Metaverse Infrastructure Service Providers (MISPs) tap into data marketplace and subscribe to resources in advance for fulfilling the needs of data consumers and users. The demand of the data based services being uncertain, non-optimal subscription schemes may lead to unwanted resource wastage or shortage. Thus, we propose a Stochastic Integer Programming (SIP) model with two phase reservation and on-demand plans for optimal resource allocation in data marketplace. Further along this line, we strive to predict the demand by leveraging Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) that is able to learn with fewer historical data in comparison to classical machine/deep learning paradigms. Extensive simulation results justify that QNN as a supporting model can significantly reduce the computational complexities of SIP formulation. This research can contribute to reduce Metaverse resource fabrication costs, upgrade the profit margin for MISPs by increasing data based service sales revenue, provide real-time resource management decisions, and overall make real impacts in the virtual world.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Smart Cart: Revolutionizing E-Commerce in India with AI-Powered Personalized Product Recommendations Overview</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid evolution of e-commerce has intensified the need for effective personalization to enhance user experience. This paper introduces SmartCart, an innovative website that integrates cutting-edge AI technologies to provide personalized product recommendations based on image uploads. Users can interact with the platform by uploading images of products they like and selecting from various AI models designed for different recommendation tasks. These models include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image similarity analysis and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for contextual product suggestions. SmartCart leverages these technologies to offer highly relevant and visually similar product recommendations, aiming to improve user satisfaction and engagement. Despite its advancements, SmartCart faces limitations inherent to AI in e-commerce. Challenges such as the variability in image quality, the need for extensive training data, and potential biases in model predictions can impact the accuracy and relevance of recommendations. Additionally, the system's effectiveness is constrained by the diversity of user preferences and the capability of AI models to generalize across different product categories. This paper explores how SmartCart addresses these challenges and discusses future directions for improving AI-driven recommendation systems in the context of e-commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Development of AI model to analyze the customer behavior by decision making system</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Understanding the connection between the traits of consumers' mental processes and the rules of behaviour as they shop for and use goods and services is essential in consumer behaviour. E-commerce, or online shopping, has exploded in popularity along with the rise of smartphones and other mobile devices. Courses focusing on student happiness are essential for implementing experiential learning in E-commerce and consumer behaviour. This research suggests that online retailers use AI image recognition technologies to identify and interpret customers' facial emotions. To begin, it examines how human-computer interaction (HCI) works in electronic commerce and how HCI technology might increase product satisfaction among end users. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) is utilised to realise individualised product suggestions to anticipate customers' psychological behaviour and consumer psychology. Education on consumer behaviour helps comprehend customer happiness and create practical products. Consumers report high satisfaction with the items the system suggests, and the level of sanctification achieved in the experiments reaches 93.2%. The assessment shows that the DNN model can pick up on consumer behaviour patterns, and its prediction effect is ten per cent higher than that of the classic model, proving that the DNN model is a good fit for the recommendation system. Understanding customer happiness in E-commerce is greatly aided by this research since it gives a reference for HCI-based behavioural analysis of consumer psychology within the framework of AI.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multi-Algorithm Fusion Pharmaceutical Sales Forecasting Mode</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, China's pharmaceutical e-commerce industry has developed rapidly, and now the industry has entered a critical stage of development. However, when the merchants stationed in the pharmaceutical platform, there are still many problems with the recognition of the pharmaceutical e-commerce and the positioning of the sales target. Many businesses are facing the risk of continuous loss and bankruptcy in the increasingly fierce competition due to their vague positioning and unclear strategic layout. Therefore, this paper mainly analyzes the sales data of merchants staying on the medical platform, and then makes sales forecasts. The sales data involves the number of new users on the day, so first use the time series model ARIMA to predict the number of new users, and then the predicted number of new users is put into the data to predict sales. Time series models ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost are used as the base models and LightGBM is used as the final prediction model to predict merchant sales using Stacking strategies. This method concentrates the advantages of each model, greatly improves the accuracy of sales forecasts for pharmaceutical merchants, and is of great significance to merchants' decision-making.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Prediction and Evaluation of Amazon Product’s Reputation Based on the Improved SSA-LSTM Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rise of the Internet has promoted the vigorous development of online shopping. Evaluating and predicting the reputation of products is of great significance for sellers to identify the reputation trend of products and make sales plans in time. In this paper, based on the customer reviews data for hair dryer provided by Sunshine Company for Amazon Markets from August 2005 to August 2015, we propose five indexes: number of reviews, high confidence review rate, weighted average rating star, weighted average review score, and review score skewness. Then we use SSA-LSTM (Singular Spectrum Analysis-Long Short-Term Memory networks) time series method to predict the trend of product reputation. We find that the time series data processed by SSA has higher prediction accuracy than the unprocessed data, which proves that SSA processing can improve the accuracy of product reputation prediction. Moreover, we propose a product reputation evaluation method combining star rating and review data and use improved SSA-LSTM time series prediction method to predict product reputation. Overall, our results indicate that the above methods have achieved high prediction accuracy and have certain reference value for sellers' sales strategy formulation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Evaluation of E-commerce Logistics Service Quality using Online Customer Reviews with Bi-LSTM and Bahdanau Attention</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this research, of evaluation of E-commerce logistic service quality using the customer reviews has become important prediction to satisfy the customer. Logistic services were evaluated by traditional approaches such as interviews, surveys. Machine learning (ML) methods consume more time to extract public opinions and also failed to analyze the mixed opinions with noise in the raw data. To overcome these challenges and to predict the customer's mixed reviews and Logistics service quality evaluation effectively, a DL (Deep learning) algorithm namely Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) is integrated with Bahdanau Attention Algorithm (Bi-LSTM- Bahdanau Attention). The attention algorithm is employed to increase performance and signify accurate emotion. Initially, employed Yelp review dataset, pre- processing is performed through text cleaning, tokenization and padding to reduce noise. The feature extraction is performed to the obtained processed data using word embedding (Word2Vec), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which converts the text to vector data. The classification is performed using the proposed Bi-LSTM-Bahdanau Attention model and has achieved higher accuracy of 95.67%, precision 94.89% and recall is 99.54% respectively when compared to conventional methods such as LSTM and Triple Graph Neural Network (TGNN).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Product Recommender System Using Hypergraph Neural Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Improving the performance of recommender systems in the field of product purchase has been one of the important challenges of e-commerce in recent years. The correct recognition of the user's preference and the accurate recommendation of items that meet his needs will certainly lead to progress in the development of online shopping and selling of items. Since the meaning of each item is different for users and the purpose of buying that item changes over time, it is difficult to understand what the user's thinking is now and what kind of product they are looking for. In this work, an approach based on hypergraph neural networks is presented to create a powerful representation for items and users, which can be used to create a correct representation for the user's intent and finally, according to his dynamic intent, offer him/her the right product. The idea of this approach is to use the short-term correlation of items with each other to give them meaning, which is very similar to the logic of buying items by people in the real world. To evaluate the approach, the results of the implementation of the model presented in this article and similar models in recent years are compared on a dataset called Amazon review, and the improvement of the results of the evaluation metrics compared to those models is observed.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>EPR-ML: E-Commerce Product Recommendation Using NLP and Machine Learning Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Using tags and other forms of textual information, online retailers can create their product listings, descriptions, and categories. E-commerce information services, such as search and product recommendation, depend significantly on textual features to assist buyers in finding the items they want. This research focuses on “tags,” which often use textual descriptions of items. We assume that merchants are not always the “best” suppliers of item tag information, either because they are ill-equipped to do so (since they have not been “trained”) or because they are purposefully attempting to rig the system by using misleading or erroneous tags to sell their commodities (tag spam). To address these concerns, we may use automated tag recommendation techniques to enhance the precision with which we suggest tags for every specific product. We proposed EPR-ML for E-commerce product recommendation using NLP and ML algorithms. This research employed a product sentiment dataset normalized using NLP; the best features were selected using Logistic regression (LR). The classification was performed using various machine learning algorithms, including Linear support vector machine (L- SVM) and Gaussian nave Bayes (GNB), to determine which model is most accurate at predicting the number of days it will take a video to trend from the time it was uploaded and the number of days it will trend on the trending list. Using LSVM, the research achieved a maximum accuracy of 96%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unveiling The Convergence Dynamics of A Graph Recommender System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have shown performance on learning on structured data and found applications in different fields like biology, physics, transportation, e-commerce. However, the convergence dynamic of GNN models, particularly the ones for link prediction tasks, remains a challenge for better design. Existing approaches have shown that some simpler GNN architectures can be effective as complex ones when used for recommender system (recsys). This encourages the need to perceive the advantage of some components towards a model convergence. We built models for link prediction, specially recsys based on a single layer GNN and evaluate their convergence on real and generated graphs data. These recsys are based on a graph convolution layer with added scaling factor or activation function. Our theoretical and numerical results highlight the advantage of a scaling factor over an activation function. It means models which scale down features before the final output converge, compared to others. Besides, the ReLU activation function alone cannot compensate for the missing scaling factor. The takeaway and advantage of a scaling factor resides in its ability to change the direction of the hidden features vector.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Think4SCND: Reinforcement Learning With Thinking Model for Dynamic Supply Chain Network Design</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Supply chain network design is a critical strategic challenge that significantly influences operational efficiency and competitiveness in the global marketplace. This paper introduces Think4SCND, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that addresses the dynamic complexities of supply chain network design by integrating a Supply Chain Transformer Network with a Thinking Model. Our approach formulates the supply chain network design problem as a Markov Decision Process, developing an architecture capable of handling mixed discrete-continuous action spaces. The core innovation lies in the Thinking Model, which enhances the Supply Chain Transformer Network’s ability to reason about future states and evaluate decision sequences, enabling more informed and forward-looking decision-making. We propose an end-to-end training algorithm that effectively combines model-free reinforcement learning with model-based planning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Think4SCND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving near-optimal solutions with a fraction of the computational cost. The framework demonstrates superior adaptability to disruptions and strong generalization capabilities, successfully transferring knowledge from medium-sized problems to larger, unseen instances.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimizing Demand Forecast for E-commerce Sales Platforms Based on RNN-RBM Methodology</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Due to technical advancements in this digital era, particularly in the e-commerce sector, the corporate paradigm has changed substantially. A common platform for advertising products is online marketplaces, sometimes known as ecommerce platforms. Businesses in the increasingly competitive e-commerce space require a strong marketing plan to boost sales conversion and differentiate between the competitions. Selected features, preprocessing, and training of models all depend on correct sequencing. The proposed approach utilized the SG smoothing filter during the preprocessing phase. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that can be employed in feature selection to decrease the dimensionality of a dataset that contains numerous associated variables. Precise control over the qualities is necessary for RNN-RBM training. This approach appears to be far more cutting-edge than the current RBM and RNN algorithms. A significant improvement in accuracy was noted in the results, which reached 96.33%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimizing Third-Party Product Marketing Strategies Using AI-Driven Consumer Analytics</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Third party product marketing acts as an important link in identifying consumer interest from business establishments while at the same time providing brand names an opportunity to gain wider access to other outside markets. Nonetheless, conventional marketing communication approaches rarely fit the complex interaction between consumers and products, which negatively impacts targeting, customization level, and performance. This research unveils a novel GNN-based framework to overcome these difficulties for consumer and product data by capturing their interactions. The proposed method presents consumer behaviour as structure graphs, based on the E-commerce Customer Data for Behaviour Analysis dataset, in order to better support and predict customer preferences, improve segmentation and product recommendations. The GNN designed and built using Python DLP has integrated extraordinaire algorithms that support scalability of big data processing and consumer pattern learning. Assessment tests establish that technical outcomes score a classification accuracy of above 92%, which unveils the efficiency of the strategy in delivering useful knowledge. This model assists other platforms targeting the management of third-party relationships in developing better and more effective advertising strategies that improve customer appeal and sales. As well, it helps the consumers make more-informed decisions and therefore enhances their shopping experience. Beyond overcoming existing shortcomings, the study’s contribution is in increasing scalability, flexibility in adjusting to changing consumers’ demands, and itself, and insensitivity to noise. This work provides the keystone for such improvements to mainly be offered by AI-based approaches for different e-commerce marketing strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Toward Smart Internet of Things (IoT) for Apparel Retail Industry: Automatic Customer’s Body Measurements and Size Recommendation System using Computer Vision Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Internet of Things (IoT) is not a buzzword in the media outlets anymore. Over the last five years, many products, that are defined as IoT devices are widely offered for consumers starting from embedded and portable sensors with Internet connectivity to remotely distributed systems with machine learning (ML)-based-intelligence and cloud connectivity. We believe that IoT devices will widely spread as reliable products if and only if they are equipped with efficient human computer interaction (HCI) features, specifically visual interaction with users based on computer vision and machine learning. An interesting applied field for such devices is the apparel retail industry where outlets and consumers still depend on legacy methods for fitting, which cost the industry hundreds of millions due to damage or return goods. Therefore, we propose a ML-based human body measuring and size recommendation system that can provide customers of online and retail stores with accurate estimates of their body measurements with respect to the retailer size charts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system to automatically measure body parts and predict subject’s size using two RGB images only. In addition, we developed a new body measurements dataset from scratch due to the unavailable public access to such dataset. With an average error range from 0.5 to 2.5 cm, our system shows promising results for seven standard body measurements used for cloths size suggestion. In this paper, we focus on providing an innovative and new experience to revolutionize apparel industry and promote well being.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Classification and Price Prediction of Used Cars using Supervised Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Demand for used-car price prediction research has grown, which is positive for the business. People in poor nations prefer secondhand automobiles, thus there are few new ones. Important vehicle data is generated by suppliers. Every seller requires a dependable price prediction method to maximize profits. Data-driven algorithms consider the vehicle's production year and mileage to price used cars in India. This was achieved by mining data from the online shop. Data processing reduced duplicates and gaps. We utilize CarDekho.com data to estimate used car pricing components to construct strong Machine Learning (ML) models for using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naïve Bayes (NB). The model performed year of production, miles, gasoline type, seller type, gearbox type, prior owners, mileage, engine size, and maximum power are listed. We translated units to numbers and calculated the car's age during data processing. An exploratory study shows that age, brand, and power determine automobile costs more than seat capacity and engine size. The researchers examined transformational and variable selection models. The ML model explained 90% of used vehicle price predictions. After validation, the model showed a 10% MAPE between real and anticipated prices. Used vehicle buyers and sellers may benefit from KNN and NB price forecasts. Data-driven methods are needed to optimize pricing and navigate market prediction. The performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithms using three error metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). KNN performs better than NB, having lower error values across all three metrics</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Learning Framework for Student Course Recommender System for Higher Educational Institutions</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the advancement in technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) there are many sub fields which are emerged from the core areas. Deep Learning (DL) is one such field which is gaining vast importance and is often mentioned as branch of ML and AI. In order to quickly and efficiently find the relevant information on the internet based on our past browsing history, recommender systems are playing a major role. Many such systems has been proposed in recent works. Recommender system has been implemented in major E-commerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix, YouTube and many other giants have introduced AI based recommendation systems. Most of these systems uses the algorithms which can efficiently collect user behavioral data, filter it and recommends the user various choices based on the previous data. These systems often need to develop their own framework and algorithms which can solve the purpose. Students are often confused to opt for courses out of various options available in today's digital world. Based on their skill, interest the system should recommend a course. A general framework where it can handle data diversity, various dimensions and stimulation types is needed. Deep learning based generalized framework can solve such type of issues. In this paper we propose such generalized and effective Deep learning framework for a student course recommendation system for students who wish to pursue a course in various Higher Educational Institutions. The recommender system can be useful for the students who wish to opt a particular course based on their past history of interest and data collected from the logs. In this paper we use the Intel OpenVino toolkit for the deployment of the recommender system. The recommender system which is based on deep learning will provide the student with the exact set of modules he need to choose based on his skill set. The result of a student recommender system using deep learning can vary depending on several factors, including the quality of the data, the effectiveness of the model, and the specific goals of the recommender system. In this paper we focused on better performance, personalized learning paths and enhanced student satisfaction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Employing Deep Learning Methods for Predicting Helpful Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce dominates a large part of the world's economy with many websites dedicated to selling products online. The vast majority of e-commerce websites provide their customers with the ability to express their opinions about the products/services they purchase. These reviews represent a rich source of information about the users' experiences, which is of great benefit to both the producer and the consumer. In This paper we present a set of machine/deep learning models, especially using Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) to predict the helpfulness of reviews. Mainly, two approaches are used: a supervised learning approach and a semi-supervised approach. The latter is a unique aspect of our work and it takes advantage of a large number of unlabeled reviews. The results show that both approaches are better than existing approaches. Moreover, the results show that the second approach has a remarkably better performance compared with the first one, which is in accordance with recent trends in machine/deep learning that focus on benefiting from the huge amount of unlabeled data to enhance the performance of supervised models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>FootwearFusion: Convolutional Neural Network for Shoe, Sandal, and Boot Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A fundamental task in computer vision, footwear categorization finds many applications in the retail, security, and fashion industries. This paper employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to compare and categorize three popular footwear types: shoes, boots, and sandals. The collection is made up of photos that were gathered from several sources and feature a range of footwear brands, colors, and styles. High accuracy rates on both training and validation sets show how effective CNNs are at differentiating between shoes, boots, and sandals based on experimental results. It also examines the effect of class imbalance and dataset size on model performance, offering solutions and insights into possible problems. The present study serves as a standard for assessing future developments in this field and delivers insightful information about the use of deep learning algorithms for footwear categorization in manufacturing technology. Promising outcomes and practical deployment in real-world applications, such as automated inventory management, e-commerce product categorization, and security screening systems, are possible with the created model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Prediction of Customer Interest in E-Commerce Data using Sentimental Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online retailers manage enormous customer datasets containing review feedback as well as ratings information. Expansion of business sales together with superior customer experiences requires businesses to comprehend customer interests and forecast upcoming purchasing patterns. The current evaluation methods utilize both heuristic models through rule-based systems while demonstrating restricted capabilities for expansion and flexibility. Modern developments in deep learning together with sentiment analysis technologies produce better predictions of customer interest through the analysis of product review text alongside social media content. This research recommends a sophisticated sentiment analysis solution that implements Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) to advance sentiment detection along with customer interest forecasting. The proposed solution exceeds traditional techniques because it uses contextual word representations together with transformer self-attention processing to identify subtle semantic patterns in written text.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Learning for Enhanced Consumer Behavior Analysis and Predictive Accuracy</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The accelerating digital transformation in retail necessitates advanced analytical approaches to effectively comprehend and predict consumer behavior. Existing methodologies in retail data mining often fall short in handling the complexity and heterogeneity of data, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy and operational efficiency. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a novel deep learning framework that synergizes the capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Q Learning and VARMAx models. The proposed model adeptly fuses data from diverse sources such as Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, and Flipkart, creating a comprehensive analysis platform. By leveraging the relational data structure processing power of GNNs and the dynamic decision-making proficiency of Q Learning, along with the time series predictive strength of VARMAx models, this approach offers a more holistic understanding of consumer trends. The efficacy of this model is demonstrated through extensive testing on varied data samples encompassing social media, e-commerce platforms, and tweets. The results are compelling: an 8.3% increase in accuracy, 8.5% enhancement in precision, 6.5% improvement in recall, and a significant 10.4% reduction in delay compared to existing classification methods. The impact of this work is far-reaching, offering retailers a robust tool for strategic decision-making, enhanced customer insight, and a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving digital marketplace. This approach not only propels the retail industry forward but also sets a new benchmark in the application of deep learning for consumer behavior analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Fashion Clothing Design Style Recommendation using Extra Tree Classifier Combined with LSTM</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommendation System plays an vital part in e-commerce requisition as they help the consumer or user to choose the requires items within limited time. Presently, several e-commerce use a text-based artifact search which has problem to fetch the most alike products of the system. However, most cloth recommendation have several limitations such as; high source consumption, inconsistence subjectively cloth labeled. To overcome above limitation this paper is mainly focused to Extra Tree Classifier (ETC) based feature sub categorization method to overcome the high time consuming and provide intelligent recommendation of clothing style. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) used to recognize effective features for future recommendation. To train the identified aspects with to make efficient rating prediction the numerical function of LSTM based feature extraction are used more effective enables user to select the most rated item (clothing) of the function. The proposed ETC-LSTM method increases exploration and exploitation which helps to improve the user recommendation based rating. The production of the ETC-LSTM method in analyzed in the terms of Area Under Cover (AUC), Precision and Recall. The ETC-LSTM method has 95.347% than the existing MAlexNet-JSEPCC, DVESM-CAE and SLT-DT.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Neighbor Interaction Aware Graph Neural Network for Collaborative Filtering</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recently, recommendation algorithms based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated robust capabilities in learning representations of users and items. However, these methods often rely on aggregation functions like sum/mean/max pooling operations to form user and item representations, overlooking the importance of interaction information between neighboring nodes for node representation. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Neighbor Interactions Aware Graph Neural Network (NIA-GNN) method for collaborative filtering. This approach explicitly models both the aggregation and interaction information of neighboring nodes, capturing relationship information between adjacent nodes to enhance user and item representations, improve recommendation effectiveness, and boost the model's predictive power. We perform extensive experiments on two real datasets to confirm that NIA-GNN significantly enhances recommendation performance. Further analysis underscores the significance of neighbor interaction information in refining user and item representations, validating the rationale and efficacy of the NIA-GNN method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Classifying and Predicting The Rating Sentiment of Women's E-commerce Clothing Reviews: A Comparative Study Using SVM, ANN, and BERT Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product reviews are crucial for both customers and sellers in determining the quality of certain products. Alongside the review, the rating is also provided to give insight into the overall point of the product. As the review often becomes a consideration for a customer when buying a product online, the review needs to give an objective viewpoint. Therefore, it is important to determine whether the review is reliable. This could be seen both from the rating given by customers and the sentiment of the review. Machine learning and deep learning methods can be applied to classify the review sentiment effectively. The main objective was to check whether the review was considered positive or negative. The review was provided from women’s clothing e-commerce by Nicapotato, which is available on Kaggle. This paper used both SVM and ANN for machine learning methods and BERT for deep learning method to determine the best method for the given dataset by identifying the most reliable and accurate model for classifying reviews. For the text vectorization, SVM and ANN models used TF-IDF technique while BERT model used sentenceBERT. The best method was determined quantitatively by comparing each model's accuracy and F1 Score results. Based on the accuracy and F1 Score result, it turned out that using TF-IDF for text vectorization with ANN gave the best performance compared to other models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Peak Period Demand Forecasting with Proxy Data: GNN-Enhanced Meta-Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Demand prediction is a crucial task for e-commerce and physical retail businesses, especially during high-stake sales events. However, the limited availability of historical data from these peak periods poses a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages proxy data from non-peak periods, enriched by features learned from a graph neural networks (GNNs) based forecasting model, to predict demand during peak events. We formulate the demand prediction as a meta-learning problem and introduce the Feature-based First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (F-FOMAML) algorithm, which adapts to new tasks by conditioning on the GNN-generated relational metadata. Empirical evaluations on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, with our model consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in the demand prediction task, by 26.24% on the internal vending machine dataset and 8.7% on the public JD.com dataset over the Mean Absolute Error.</dcterms:abstract>

Besides, we have applied six different machine learning algorithms (Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD)) to predict and analyze the polarity of public sentiments. Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique has been applied by using Trigram features. Finally, after optimizing the hyperparameters using the Randomized-SearchCV algorithm, SVM classifier has been found to demonstrate the highest accuracy of 90.68% for predicting public sentiments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning-Based Customer Behavior Analysis for E-commerce Platforms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Providing a method that is founded on machine learning to analyze the behavior of customers on e-commerce platforms is the objective of this research study, which aims to provide a method. It is necessary for companies that engage in e-commerce to know and anticipate the behavior of their customers to enhance the success of their marketing efforts and to improve the amount of enjoyment that they deliver to their customers. This is because the popularity of buying online is expanding at a rate that is accelerating at an exponential rate. To identify patterns and trends in consumer behavior, our solution makes use of machine learning techniques to analyze large-scale transactional data, user interactions, and demographic information. This analysis is made to detect patterns and trends. Within the context of consumer behavior, this analysis is carried out to identify patterns and trends. Through the utilization of techniques such as clustering, classification, and predictive modeling, we can recognize distinct client types, estimate purchase trends, and anticipate future behaviors.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sentiment Identification System for E-Commerce Mobile App Reviews Using Single Layer Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the technological era, e-commerce offers business opportunities, particularly through the simplicity of the process of buying or selling products through the Internet. The upkeep of the customer experience must be recognized by e-commerce service providers as a top priority for businesses. Customers can access the global market, compare prices across regions, and even easily compare the services of various e-commerce apps. Online customer reviews on e-commerce mobile apps play an important role, which can be used as personal recommendations for other customers. Because customers rely on the opinions of other customers, negative reviews from customers will deter potential users from downloading the e-commerce mobile app in the future. The system described in this paper uses a single-layer neural network to automatically predict and analyze customer sentiments from online customer reviews. The proposed sentiment identification system model achieved the best performance among the algorithms; it attained an overall sensitivity of 96.2%, specificity of 93.8%, accuracy of 95.0%, and MCC of 0.90. Additionally, the researchers developed a fast and reliable web-based system for identifying sentiment from customer reviews.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Construction of prediction models for perceptual imagery of product shape by GABPNN and SOA-BPNN</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To improve the efficiency and scope of vocabulary and sample collection in traditional Kansei engineering (KE), and to address the issue of poor accuracy in predicting product form imagery, this study introduces a novel research framework that incorporates elements of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning, and optimization algorithms. Initially, product samples and Kansei vocabulary were collected from e-commerce platforms using Python web crawlers and Word2vec, with representative samples and vocabulary selected. Following this, Kansei prediction models were developed using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), a nonlinear machine learning method, and enhanced with the application of the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve their performance. Lastly, an error comparison of the prediction models was conducted to determine the optimal model for guiding product form design, with hair dryer products used as the case study for validation. The results indicate that the SOA-BPNN model had the smallest prediction error, demonstrating that employing SOA to enhance BPNN's performance in predicting users’ emotional responses to product form is reliable. The SOA-BPNN model also showed greater robustness, making it suitable for predicting form imagery in product design. Moreover, this research framework provides valuable insights for related studies in KE.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendation of Marketplace using Filter-based Model for Farmers</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture and related industries are vital for rural employment and income, contributing significantly to the country's economy. However, agricultural productivity in India lags behind other countries, especially in terms of yield per unit of land. This low productivity, coupled with financial challenges, has led to a concerning trend of farmer suicides, particularly among small-scale farmers. Increasing agricultural revenue and production requires action for dealing with these problems. This paper proposes a recommendation system for farmers to choose the best marketplace for their crops, based on analyzing historical data from various Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) datasets. The recommendation model of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques and is trained on data from APMCs in Amravati District, Maharashtra, India. The model demonstrates improved performance, achieving higher recall rates at both top-5 and top-10 recommendations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Commodity Demand Forecasting of E-Commerce Merchants Based on the Stacking Fusion Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rise of e-commerce platforms and the continuous expansion of market scale, how to supply and distribute and manage the goods in e-commerce supporting warehouses is a factor that needs to be considered by every merchant. In order to reduce merchants' inventory costs and fulfill commitments on time, this paper establishes a forecasting model based on the Stacking fusion model combined with grid search. With “merchant - warehouse - commodity” as a time series about commodity demand on the time axis, the Stacking fusion model is established. It integrates XGBoost, LishtGBM and Catboost machine learning models, and adopts grid search and cross-validation methods for parameter optimization. Prediction accuracy, recall rate, goodness of fit coefficient, root-mean-square error and 5% error accuracy were used to evaluate the prediction performance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Using Deep Learning and Sentiment Analysis to Identify Mismatches between Online Courses’ Reviews and Ratings</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Thousands of reviews and ratings are created on the internet by reviewers expressing satisfaction or lack thereof, towards a product or service. With all this massive amount of information available, it raises a problem when it comes to analysing the vast information generated from all the reviews created. Mismatches between reviews and ratings occur in some cases, this research project explores the e-commerce mismatch problem regarding the analysis of review data. Some interesting studies have been conducted within the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable a machine to essentially analyse and extract information from these raw forms of text, most of the studies only focus on sentiment analysis alone. We used sentiment analysis as a basis for further predictive analysis to determine the relationship between reviews and their corresponding ratings in order to detect any mismatches between them. We perform sentiment analysis combined with deep learning on reviews scrapped from the Coursera online learning platform. We explored NLP pre-processing techniques such as text vectorization in order to prepare the reviews for classification and comparison with their respective ratings to identify any mismatches between them. Overall, the 10-fold cross validation model achieved an average accuracy of around 87% with regards to predicting the sentiment class for a given review, the predicted sentiment was used for comparison with the given ratings in order to determine whether there might be a mismatch between them.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Retail Analytics in the New Normal: The Influence of Artificial Intelligence and the Covid-19 Pandemic</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the retail landscape and has accelerated the adoption of innovative technologies. A striking example relates to the proliferation of online grocery orders and the technology deployed to facilitate such logistics. In fact, for many retailers, this disruption was a wake-up call after which they started recognizing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). In this article, we discuss the opportunities that AI can offer to retailers in the new normal retail landscape. Some of the techniques described have been applied at scale to adapt previously deployed AI models, whereas in other instances, fresh solutions needed to be developed to help retailers cope with recent disruptions, such as unexpected panic buying, retraining predictive models, and leveraging online–offline synergies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Comparative Performance Analysis using Machine Learning for Churn Prediction in E-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>New clients cost a business significantly more money in e-commerce than keeping its existing clients. Companies can boost consumer retention, which will result in more revenue and faster growth, by anticipating which customers will quit. There are several products and solutions in today’s competitive industry. Because of this, most clients are accustomed to quickly switching from one brand to another and from one supplier to another in their search for the best possible product or item to fulfill their requirements. This problem, known as “client churn,” affects e-commerce enterprises. Due to their ability to process large volumes of data and recognize complex patterns, machine learning algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for predicting client churn in recent years. Using a publicly accessible dataset, the proposed model examines various machine learning methods for predicting customer churn in this study. Also, by using performance metrics, the proposed model compares how well different algorithms perform.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An End-to-end Machine Learning System for Mitigating Checkout Abandonment in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) has become one of the most significant consumer-facing tech industries in recent years. This industry has considerably enhanced people’s lives by allowing them to shop online from the comfort of their own homes. Despite the fact that many people are accustomed to online shopping, e-commerce merchants are facing a significant problem, a high percentage of checkout abandonment. In this study, we have proposed an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) system that will assist the merchant to minimize the rate of checkout abandonment with proper decision making and strategy. As a part of the system, we developed a robust ML model that predicts if someone will checkout the products added to the cart based on the customer’s activity. Our system also provides the merchants with the opportunity to explore the underlying reasons for each single prediction output. This will indisputably help the online merchants in business growth and effective stock management.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Footwear Classification Using Pretrained CNN Models with Deep Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study proposes a deep learning ensemble approach for classifying footwear images into three distinct categories: boots, sandals, and shoes. By leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of two widely used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, VGG16 and Xception, the method aims to enhance classification accuracy through a combined model architecture. Each model underwent selective fine-tuning, where specific layers were unfrozen to allow for retraining on the dataset, thus optimizing feature extraction for the target classes. This step was followed by the addition of a densely connected deep neural network layer to generate the final predictions. To improve generalization and minimize overfitting, comprehensive data augmentation techniques were implemented, including rotations, zooming, and horizontal flipping, as well as a series of callbacks such as early stopping and learning rate reduction. The ensemble model achieved high accuracy rates and demonstrated robust performance across key evaluation metrics, including precision-recall, F1-score, accuracy for each footwear category. The results underscore the effectiveness of using pretrained model ensembling for complex image classification tasks, suggesting its potential for application in domains like e-commerce and fashion, where accurate product categorization is crucial for enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

This disclosure article describes the use of the GluonTS library for the creation of probabilistic time series based on deep learning models to make forecasts related to the production of crude oil by a federal entity, considering as a practical example the set of open data published by the Ministry of Energy (SENER) of the Mexico Government. These data sets have substantial value as they can be leveraged to make better forecasts or detect anomalies more effectively, which in turn translates into a valuable strategy to aid forecast-based decision making. To expose the application of this tool, the definition, training, evaluation and visualization of the results of a deep learning model for time series was carried out using the Python programming language.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendations of Compatible Accessories in e-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>We address the problem of learning how compatible two products are. Assessing compatibility is challenging because the meaning of compatibility changes depending on product categories. In this study, we leverage domain experts' knowledge to generate labels and datasets. Next, we engineer 58 different features from product titles and product descriptions. We experiment with both tree-based and deep learning classifiers using different sets of features to capture compatibility patterns across four product categories. Although the performance does not show consistent pattern across all categories, the precision and recall of the best algorithm from most categories are above 90%. In addition, we find that the performance of classifiers are in general satisfactory. Based on human validation, few best-performing classifiers demonstrate better performance than labels generated from domain experts.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Tievs: Classified Advertising Enhanced Using Machine Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The scarce use of tangible periodicals led to a consistently soaring popularity of online classified advertising. Nevertheless, existing platforms retain complications. Most recommendation systems are built with conventional technologies that are less scalable, less accurate, and having high latency processes. Moreover, customers find it tiring when clarifying a reliable, precise price value for items they are trying to sell through the classified advertising system. Additionally, strict validation techniques to identify and prevent fraudulent content or images from being published in the advertising portals have been neglected. Therefore, authors have inaugurated a superior classified advertising system, Tievs, as a solution, by appraising said predicaments. It wields a flexible, process-simplifying, concurrency-induced recommendation breakthrough implemented from Universal Sentence Encoding incurred Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning routines. Furthermore, an innovative price prediction system having a supervised regression-based ensemble model forged ensuing a comparative study, having excellent accuracy in proactively predicting item prices as to cater hassles faced by customers, was satisfied. Light Gradient Boosting classifier-driven fake description analysis and a Convolution Neural Network powered figure deception recognition system were introduced, which gained prodigious precision with moral clarity in fraud detection and prevention. Hence, the proposed solution's objective of surpassing former classified advertising systems in delivering customers' necessities, using the most lucrative, time-saving, human-centric, and error-preventive approaches, was accomplished. It was affirmative by the positively responded questionnaire regulated among prospective users by the authors.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Product Recommendation System Using Large Language Model: Llama-2</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product recommendation systems are an essential part of many e-commerce platforms. They help users discover new products that they are likely to be interested in, and can also increase sales and engagement. Traditional recommendation systems typically use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to generate recommendations. However, these systems have limitations, such as the cold start problem and the difficulty of capturing complex user preferences. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising new approach to product recommendation. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can learn to understand and generate human language at a high level. This makes them well-suited for tasks such as product recommendation, which require the ability to understand user preferences and product descriptions. In this paper, we propose a product recommendation system that uses the Llama-2 LLM. Our system works by first generating a personalized user embedding for each user. This embedding captures the user’s preferences based on their past interactions with the system. The system then uses this embedding to generate a ranked list of recommended products for the user. We evaluated our system on a real-world dataset of user interactions with an e-commerce platform. Our results show that our system outperforms traditional recommendation systems on a variety of metrics, including click-through rate and purchase rate.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Conceptual Analysis of Product Evaluations Using Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The process of classifying a small text piece into positive, negative or neutral is called as Sentiment Analysis. For example, if a message is considered, then the meaning of the sentence is identified and then analysis of the sentence has to be done. After analysis, we decide that the sentence is either positive, either negative or neutral. This is referred to as Sentiment Analysis. Nowadays, most of the people prefer the online products compared to the direct buyers. So, the online marketing is growing very high. In fact, the online marketing is fully satisfying the customer needs so that it occupies a great place in people's heart. They are also satisfying the demands of customers with high quality and low price. These are the primary reasons for the online marketing to be in a successful position. If an e-commerce company has an ability to gather information about the customer thoughts and behavior, then the online marketing will be more effective than now. In this paper, we have taken a particular e-commerce dataset called Flipkart and classify the polarity of the comments by using some of the classifiers namely Support Vector Machine Classifier, Guassian Naïve Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier. The existing approach is that the comments were classified based on the attitude of the customer. But, now the proposed approach has been implemented with the help of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network Classifier which is simulated by the SPYDER tool. The accuracy for all the four algorithms namely, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network algorithm has been computed and the best accuracy has been predicted by comparing them. Here, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) shows the best accuracy of all others and the accuracy is 99.94%. Moreover, some performance metrics has been determined here. The performance metrics namely Precision, Recall and F-measure has been evaluated for each algorithm individually and then the comparison is made among them. Then, the ROC curve is measured for the classes designated by us for revealing the recognition of parameters between two diagnostic groups. It is predicted individually for each class. At last, the Confusion Matrix is going to enumerate for each algorithm distinctly. It presents the actual and predicted values in a tabular format thereby measuring the performance of a classifier.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>SmartReview: A Blockchain-based Transaction Review System for Decentralized Marketplaces</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Over the last few years, e-commerce has seen tremendous growth, with much of the businesses centered around centralized marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. However, these markets suffer from single-point failures and market monopolies. Decentralized marketplaces overcome these deficiencies by governing through consensus. For these markets to become popular, it is necessary to provide customers with a trustworthy reputation system based on honest reviews. Today’s review systems suffer from several weaknesses including scant buyer feedback, often based on emotion rather than facts. To overcome these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose SmartReview, an automated review system that is based on blockchain and smart contracts. SmartReview system is built as a multilayered architecture, with each layer handling different aspects of transaction execution in decentralized markets. The review module is conceived to be a smart contract that takes the contract terms and conditions and the evidence provided by the buyer and seller as inputs, and employs advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to arrive at a quantitative and qualitative review for each transaction. These reviews are objective and do not suffer from reviewer bias. Further, the reputation layer takes these as inputs and arrives at a dynamic predictive reputation for the sellers, by employing time-series-based prediction algorithms. The effectiveness of these layers is illustrated through examples. While what is described is a proof-of-concept, future plans are to build a full-fledged system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Automating Product Classification in E-Commerce through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>An efficient product category classification has now emerged as a vital element of the rapidly developing world of e-commerce and online retail, providing better control over inventory and enabling customized presentations for each customer. This paper presents the investigation into using machine learning techniques to automatically classify products based on textual descriptions. Using a large, annotated dataset, authors collect information by extracting relevant information from product descriptions and use advanced methods in both machine learning and natural language processing in showing well the classification of categories of products. The study also includes the critically important data gathering, preprocessing, and feature extraction phases that are vital in harvesting subtle semantic-related information hidden in descriptions of products. The process involves careful selection and implementation of complex algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Linear SVM, best suited for dealing with product categorization-specific problems. Thus, training and validation procedures play a vital role in optimizing the model parameters so that the model can perform robustly on unseen data and hence generalize effectively to new products. The model, deployed on an e-commerce platform, provides real-time category prediction as new products are added into the system. It regularly updates and maintains itself so that any variations in the product catalog or changes in the structures of language used over time in describing products are incorporated within the model. It has addressed issues such as data incompleteness and inconsistency and therefore offers integrated methods that may lead to improving the accuracy of predictions. The system is flexible and adaptive and capable of learning and evolving over time, according to new categories that may arise and different contexts of operations. The results do reflect significant strides in creating large-scale, efficient machine learning solutions for e-commerce, automating the process of product category prediction and the further efficiency enhancement of online commerce platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Innovative Approaches in Predictive Analysis and Personalized Online Shopping Recommendations with AI Powered-Chat</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customers are more exposed than ever to the necessary quantity of information about goods and services nowadays. As a result, there is a great deal of variability in consumer demand, making it difficult for retailers to provide the appropriate goods and services in accordance with client preferences. Recommender systems can use consumer evaluations, comments, and shared experiences regarding a product as an efficient way to learn about the preferences of the customer. Users' buying lists, viewer lists, and product purchase counts are regarded as the primary core attributes for doing the analysis of the items watched and purchased in order to recommend products to users. This uses a hybrid recommendation methodology that blends data analytics, collaborative filtering, and machine learning. It is possible to create a framework for forecasting consumer behavior. Users are increasingly using social media in the current situation to get prompt customer assistance; however, the majority of these complaints were unanswered or not addressed at all. A new conversational system has been created to automatically generate responses to user inquiries on social media in order to address this problem.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AMIF: A Hybrid Model for Improving Fact Checking in Product Question Answering</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Fact checking in product-related community question answering is the task of verifying the truthfulness of an answer towards a given question, where the study has just begun. Most existing related work has focused on tailoring solutions to shallow feature fusion for the single-text claim involved with fact-checked evidence, limiting their success and generality in such answer truthfulness prediction task on E-commerce platforms. In this study, we propose an attention-based hybrid framework for multi-feature interaction fusion to determine the truthfulness of the answer towards a product-related question in E-commerce, which could not only support fine-grained semantic calibration between question-answer pairs for better understanding of the target answers, but also substantially cross-check all retrieved evidence to mine coherent opinions towards the pair. In addition, our framework further integrates non-textual features from metadata for improving performance. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world representative benchmark data show that our proposed model achieves superior performance on the task of answer veracity prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AdaBoost Algorithm for Marketplace Product Similarity Detection</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The marketplace is a platform that has a duty as an intermediary between sellers who want to sell and buyers who want to buy a product with an online transaction process. So a marketplace website only acts as a third party in handling product transactions in terms of ordering products and several online payment methods provided by the marketplace. It can be seen in several marketplaces such as Shopee, Lazada, Tokopedia, and so on. Of course, they have a lot of products, for example, clothing, staple foods, electronic devices, and many others. With so many products in a marketplace, of course, many products look the same but users or buyers often or don't even know that one product and several other products are the same. In this study, the author uses a product similarity dataset and uses the AdaBoost algorithm to get high classification results. In the dataset used, to classify, the author uses product titles and images which will later be used to distinguish one product from another. For the classification results using the AdaBoost algorithm, an accuracy of 91.81% is obtained, with the accuracy of the score, which means that the model developed by the author has a very good performance in detecting product similarities based on product titles and images in a marketplace.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Classification Of Hookah Images With Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the proliferation of social media usage, there has been a notable increase in posts related to hookah consumption, driven by its visually appealing presentation and distinctive consumption method. Such posts, especially in the context of the decreasing age of social media users, have the potential to exert an enticing influence. The potential impact of social media content on tobacco product consumption underscores the importance of identifying whether these posts contain tobacco-related imagery. Deep learning techniques have become increasingly prevalent in the detection of tobacco products within images and videos. However, existing studies have predominantly focused on cigarette detection due to its relatively higher consumption rates, leaving the area of hookah detection underexplored. In this study, the detection of hookah images in social media content was undertaken using the YOLO v5 algorithm, a version of convolutional neural networks, for the classification of hookah as an object in digital images. To achieve this, a dataset comprising 7200 hookah images of varying shapes, colors, and sizes was compiled from social media platforms and various e-commerce websites. The dataset was trained using the YOLO v5 xl model, and the experimental results indicated a detection accuracy of 98.88%. The findings of this experimental study indicate that the developed application could be employed to generate alerts or obscure hookah images in social media content.

        <dc:title>Predicting E-Commerce Checkout Abandonment Using Gradient Boosting Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The checkout abandonment trend is one of the most potent dangers to e-commerce players in the modern digital economy, leading to substantial revenue loss. A thorough understanding and modelling of this trend through website traffic behavior and user activity analysis can yield rich insights that can go a long way in the mitigation of abandonment rates. This study utilizes machine learning models, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, to predict checkout abandonment by developing models based on user behavior features extracted from user activity. The datasets used for this study include session duration, pages viewed, cart behavior, and checkout behavior, and collectively form the basis for predictive modelling. These models are tested for performance using a range of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to determine the best-performing algorithm. Results show that session duration, pages viewed, and checkout page time are predictive features with high impact. All three algorithms show high performance, with XGBoost showing the highest precision and Fl-score (Accuracy: 0.98016) and is the most effective in reducing false positives. This article also provides a critical analysis of user privacy concerns and suggests potential research areas for future studies on enhancing accuracy in forecasting through deep learning models and real-time intervention approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Online Shopping Market Analysis Using CHAID Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the modern speed of the digital marketplace, online businesses have to be aware of consumer behavior in order to compete in the online retail business. This project analyses the online shopping marketplace by applying the CHAID algorithm, determining many factors that lead towards consumer buying behavior. The analysis is carried out based on a very large dataset capturing customer demographics, browse patterns, purchase history, and preferred products. Using CHAID, this research identifies significant interactions between these variables and segmented the market into various subgroups of consumers, each coming with typical characteristics and behaviors. Such consumer groups would be very enlightening regarding the ways in which age, location, or browsing habits affect shopping behavior. Segmentation allows businesses to establish focused, personalized marketing strategies that can be related to increased customer engagement, proper product placement for each customer, leading to increased customer satisfaction and sales. Along with CHAID, other prominent advanced algorithms are SVM, ID3, GBDT, XGBoost, and many more; while the techniques of clustering aim at enhancing the accuracy of classification and forecasting. These models further refine the understanding of consumer patterns and behaviors, enabling more precise predictions of future trends. Ultimately, this project provides a blueprint for businesses to realize data-driven insights into improving online shopping experience, which impacts both customer retention and profitability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Advancing Supply Chain Management: Cloud-Based Demand Forecasting Solutions</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>On-demand information that can be provided throughout all parts of the supply chain network and through cloud-based supply chain management system optimizes resource flow, enhances cooperation, and increases adaptability. The study delves into the amalgamation of AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud solutions into demand projections for use in supply chain oversight. Inventory levels optimization, production planning streamlining and, thus, global supply chain efficiency tailoring all hinge on one factor: demand forecasting. Adopting AWS cloud services elicits a plethora of benefits; ranging from — but not limited to — scalability, flexibility and cost efficiency. AWS avails an array of instruments and provisions that enable entities to sift through copious historical data seamlessly. They can mix this with extrinsic determinants like market dynamism or even seasonal oscillations so as to arrive at those ever-accurate demand forecasts. On another front altogether is AWS’ ability to handle storage, processing plus visualization capabilities for data silos integration towards seamless real-time updates delivery on forecast reports.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Bi-Level Cargo Volume Prediction Method Based on Machine Learning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, with the rapid development of the e-commerce industry, logistics has become pivotal, and the sorting platform, as the core of logistics and distribution, has long been characterized by problems such as large fluctuations in task demand and complex personnel scheduling. This paper seeks to accurately predict the cargo volume of the sorting center through machine learning methods including exponential smoothing and Gaussian process regression. The dataset used in this paper is from the 14th MathorCup Mathematics Application Challenge 2024. time series and three times exponential smoothing methods are used to predict the daily cargo volume, the prediction accuracy reaches 89.7%, and the RMSE value is 1.836, the MAE value is 1.213. The prediction result is better than the traditional ARIMA model. In addition, the noise caused by many uncertainties and the problems caused by changes in transportation routes were considered. To solve this problem, a Gaussian process regression prediction is established, which is characterized by time series and daily cargo volume, and the prediction for the next 30 days is relatively accurate.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Experimental Evaluation of Saliency Detection Model for Product Region Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper aims to clarify effectiveness of saliency detection models, which can identify regions of human eye fixation in images, in product region prediction towards further improvement of product image extraction in the future. To confirm the effectiveness, we tested seven handcrafted feature based saliency detection models, which are developed by expert priori knowledge, and three Deep Neural Network (DNN) based saliency detection models, which can perform the automatic feature extraction without much human intervention. Our evaluation, which employed 300 product images, demonstrated that GMR model, which is classified as the handcrafted feature based saliency detection model and which is based on the assumption that the regions in image boundary are more likely to be the background, was the most effective, because prediction accuracy of GMR model was 94.80%, which was 3.47% or more higher than those of other models. Thus, GMR model, which does not require any annotated training dataset, is expected to construct the lower introduction cost and more accurate product image extraction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Stochastic Resource Optimization for Metaverse Data Marketplace by Leveraging Quantum Neural Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Metaverse can unleash the potentials of Internet of Sense (IoS) communication by intertwining objects and environment between physical world and parallel virtual world. In order to digitally experience smell or taste and navigate effortlessly in virtual reality, optimal resource allocation to strengthen sensing data based infrastructure system is a critical research challenge. The Metaverse Infrastructure Service Providers (MISPs) tap into data marketplace and subscribe to resources in advance for fulfilling the needs of data consumers and users. The demand of the data based services being uncertain, non-optimal subscription schemes may lead to unwanted resource wastage or shortage. Thus, we propose a Stochastic Integer Programming (SIP) model with two phase reservation and on-demand plans for optimal resource allocation in data marketplace. Further along this line, we strive to predict the demand by leveraging Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) that is able to learn with fewer historical data in comparison to classical machine/deep learning paradigms. Extensive simulation results justify that QNN as a supporting model can significantly reduce the computational complexities of SIP formulation. This research can contribute to reduce Metaverse resource fabrication costs, upgrade the profit margin for MISPs by increasing data based service sales revenue, provide real-time resource management decisions, and overall make real impacts in the virtual world.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Artificial Intelligence Integrated with Machine Learning for Enhancing Business in E-World</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are two technologies that are expanding quickly and have the potential to completely change how organisations conduct themselves online. While ML is a subset of AI that entails training algorithms to recognise patterns and make predictions based on data, AI entails the development of intelligent algorithms and systems that can execute activities that generally need human-like intellect. Businesses may improve customer experiences, optimise operations, and boost profitability by integrating AI and ML. This study analyses the possible advantages of ML and AI integration in e-businesses. Here, a number of application cases, including as supply chain management, fraud detection, sales and marketing, and customer support are analyzed. Furthermore, this study also analyses some of the drawbacks and shortcomings of these technologies, like the requirement for a lot of data and the possibility of bias. Overall, this study comes to the conclusion that the combination of AI and ML has the potential to improve e-commerce operations by bringing fresh perspectives, boosting productivity, and enhancing the general customer experience.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Novel Method for Predicting Consumer Purchase Behaviour on E-Commerce Platforms through Graph Neural Network Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Men and women display divergent behaviours influenced by variations in development, upbringing, and an array of social, biological, and environmental factors. These gender-based disparities substantially influence both personal and professional choices, encompassing dietary preferences and consumer purchasing behaviour. Disparities arise along the decision-making process, from requirement identification to option evaluation and selection, underscoring the importance of tailored approaches. This work presents a data-driven approach that incorporates advanced preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to examine gender-based behavioural trends. Preprocessing involved min-max normalisation and the transformation of numerical data into categorical values. Permutation importance and SHAP values were employed to discern critical aspects affecting decisions. A Degree-free GNN was utilised to model behavioural patterns. The model attained an accuracy of 96.27%, surpassing conventional methods such as LightGBM, XGB and RF in detecting gender-specific distinctions. The findings emphasise the substantial influence of gender on consumer purchasing behaviour and decision-making processes. These findings endorse the implementation of customised, gender-sensitive marketing and recommendation systems. The study provides a comprehensive framework for comprehending and forecasting gender-specific behavioural inclinations in consumer decision-making scenarios, with possible applications in targeted marketing and customised user experiences.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Implementing TANAGRA for the Visualization and Analytical Interpretation of E-commerce Datasets</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The multidisciplinary study of data mining is crucial to artificial intelligence and computer science because it allows researchers to glean useful insights from massive data sets; these datasets are essential to online shopping platforms. This field investigates the ways in which data mining. Consumer impression analysis, a rich source of qualitative data reflecting customer attitude, is the center of this study. Researchers use sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to sift through customer reviews in search of patterns and key opinion leaders. In order to provide complex insights on customer behavior, this study dives into the world of sentiment analysis and goes beyond just gathering comments. Unstructured textual data may be dynamically analyzed using ML approaches in conjunction with NLP. This method can automatically decipher intricate client data. These methods, when put together, allow for the extraction of valuable information that are critical for the development of business strategies and the improvement of digital marketplace customer interaction models. An all-inclusive data mining technique known as TANAGRA is used in the investigation. It handles problems caused by the scale and variety of big e-commerce datasets via analysis. This study's findings provide insight into the nuances of consumer behavior and point the way toward better user experience and e-commerce strategy optimization. To better understand how customers, behave on e-commerce sites, the research employs Data Mining, ML, and NLP. As a result, Computer Vision is able to analyze more complex data patterns, and AI predictive analytics get fresh understanding.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Chapter 7 Data model recommendations for real-time machine learning applications: a suggestive approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Machine learning (ML) applications have received much coverage in today’s marketplace. From automated business strategies to educational canvases to sports analytic, these systems are included everywhere. There are a bunch of ML systems that have made life easy for company administration. These applications include market segmentation, optimize pricing, suggest treatment to the patients and job recommendations. Apart from this, ML has automated churn prediction, text analysis and summarization. There are many applications that ML has simplified in terms of understanding and feasibility. ML has influenced the implementation differently but it has also changed storytelling through visualization tools. Now we live in the era of prescriptive analytics, and ML has helped develop such applications. This chapter explores the impact of ML in business development, application development through various models and practicability. One particular model may fit well for an application but it may not be suitable for other applications, and this certainly depends on the dataset and what we want to predict. This chapter attempts to clarify many of the ML models and their particular implementations. Various researchers have indicated that a particular ML paradigm performs well for a specific program. This chapter explains the ML models and their respective applications, that is, where a particular model fits in a much better way compared to others. This chapter claims that ML makes it possible to improve the reasoning process by using inductive, abductive, neural networks and genetic algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-Vigilant: An E-Commerce Assistant Smartphone Application with Customer and Seller Fraud Detection, Seller Identity Check, Legal Help, E-Shopping Features</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Ecommerce or online shopping is popular all over the world due to increased internet and smartphone usage, convenience, easy access to product and seller information, reduced communication difficulties, and changing consumer behaviors. The previous literary works on ecommerce assistants did not offer adequate support to both customers and sellers. This was due to the absence of an automated application that could predict customer and seller fraud, submit electronic complaints, search for legal help, and provide options for verifying the identity of sellers, products, and customers. To rectify the existing concerns, this paper exhibits an ecommerce assistant smartphone application that includes customer and seller side fraud prediction, seller, customer, and product identity checks, electronic complaint against fraud, legal help search, customer choice-based e-shopping feature, seller contact, inquiry, loan application for sellers, ecommerce tips, and seller review submission features. The app success measurement and fruitfulness investigation results revealed that more than 57% of investigators supported the proposed application with excellent feedback.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on Consumer Purchasing Prediction Based on XGBoost Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To predict how many consumers will buy goods in the next month helps the e-commerce platform discover potential buyers and carry out the corresponding strategic activities. After analyzing and cleaning the data, we select user purchase features to use eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to train the divided data sets. Meanwhile, we choose Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) as comparison algorithms. Expectedly, the experiments indicate that using the XGBoost algorithm to predict purchasing can improve performance. Specifically, LightGBM and LSTM increase significantly before remaining stable, whereas FCNN begins in the highest number falling dramatically to approximately the accuracy of 0.32 and keeps steady. Throughout the iteration process, the accuracy of XGBoost surpassed FCNN, and experienced a moderate increase from 0.55 to 0.67, increasing the accuracy by 12%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Digital Emotions using Sentiment Analysis for Predictive Insights on Customer Recommendations</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In an era of unprecedented digital communication and information sharing, understanding the sentiment expressed in textual data is of paramount importance. Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing, has gained significant prominence due to its potential to decipher the emotions, opinions, and attitudes conveyed through words. This research paper embarks on a journey into the realm of sentiment analysis, where we explore the nuanced interplay of words and emotions in the digital landscape. Electronic commerce (e-commerce) becomes one of the subjects most learned in the education and literature fields of the present day. Superior research in the field electronics focuses mainly on developed economies. From the e-commerce view, the experience of customers has shifted from visiting retail shops to online shopping, making the analysis of customer behavior more salient. In this dataset, the review is taken into account in this sentiment analysis, considering, executing, and analyzing effective ways. Most probabilistic models are used in current research ventures, in the area of text classification, and information retrieval, among other contexts. In turn, ecommerce has grown much broader with online shopping, which is a core platform through which shoppers may be found. In the same breath, it is very imperative to forecast the level of transactions that will be facilitated through e-commerce. This paper will focus on identifying broad patterns in the written opinions of the consumers by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective of this research is to predict whether customers will recommend the product they purchased by using the information in review text.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Real-Time Customer Emotion Analysis in E-Commerce based on Social Media Data: Insights and Opportunities</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this era of social media, understanding consumer emotions in real-time is crucial for businesses to adapt and enhance their offerings promptly. This study delves into real-time consumer emotion analysis in the e-commerce industry using social media data, propelled by the publicly available GoEmotion dataset sourced from Reddit. This dataset encompasses 58,000 comments meticulously labeled for 28 emotion categories, providing an abundant source for sentiment analysis and emotion classification, especially relevant to the e-commerce sector. Released in 2020, this dataset offers a contemporary view of consumer emotions on social media. Human annotators diligently labeled each comment, resulting in a dataset that accurately mirrors users' emotions across diverse Reddit topics. Advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), were employed to categorise the emotions expressed in the comments. The practical result of this research is a machine learning model integrated with a user interface, delivering actionable insights derived from real-time Twitter data to e-commerce companies. This integration allows businesses to tailor their products and services in alignment with consumer sentiments expressed on Twitter. Notably, the model achieved a substantial improvement in macro-average precision (0.54) compared to previous work (0.40). The BERT model demonstrated exceptional proficiency in predicting specific emotions like gratitude, love, and admiration, boasting F1-scores of 0.82, 0.57, and 0.48, respectively. Additionally, the CNN model excelled in predicting “gratitude,” demonstrating impressive precision, recall, and F1-scores. The study aims to identify the most prevalent emotions and empower businesses to customise their products and services accordingly.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing E-Commerce Retail Product Classification Based on Big Data Analysis and Natural Language Processing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Currently, most E-commerce platforms employ conventional machine learning algorithms for product classification, particularly when dealing with Chinese product titles. This classification process primarily centers on techniques like word segmentation, stop word removal, and feature engineering, with limited exploration of advanced technologies in this domain. However, recent years have witnessed significant breakthroughs in natural language processing, particularly in classification tasks, addressing various challenges like text classification, named entity recognition, and summarization of key content. Extracting valuable insights from textual data and delivering value to relevant industries has garnered substantial interest from researchers and developers. To underscore the strengths of our algorithmic model, this study leverages the traditional machine learning approach of the naive Bayes algorithm, using experimental data as a foundation. Additionally, we harness the cutting-edge BERT model from the realm of natural language processing to serve as a classification model for handling concise Chinese product titles.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Aspect Sentiment Analysis with Triplet Extraction for E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the age of e-commerce, it is critical for companies to comprehend the thoughts and feelings of their customers in order to enhance their goods and services. A powerful method for deriving insights from consumer feedback is the combination of aspect sentiment analysis and triplet extraction. The objective of this method is to recognize the characteristics or facets of a good or service under discussion, gather feedback on each component, and create connections between the components, feedback, and viewpoints. Businesses can gain important insights into customer feelings towards certain features like design, usability, price, and customer service by examining customer reviews, comments, and ratings. Opinion sources (experts, customers, etc.), sentiment expressions (positive, negative, or neutral), and opinion targets (aspects) are all identified from the text as part of the triplet extraction process. This gives companies a comprehensive grasp of the thoughts and preferences of their customers, which helps them design products, set prices, and provide customer service with more focus and eventually increase customer happiness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Income Forecasting for Multi-Category Product using ARIMA Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid development of e-commerce platforms has brought significant changes in consumer behavior and business marketing strategies. In facing increasingly tight competition, some online stores need to predict revenue for the products they have. However, most online stores have more than one category, so it is necessary to evaluate predictions for each category. This problem can be handled by implementing Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). This approach can be used to handle non-stationarity by having &quot;integrated&quot; components become stationary through differencing. The average MAPE value of all categories of cosmetic products is 12.144%. The development of this prediction system is in accordance with the stages in CRISP-DM. This approach provides a structured framework for carrying out data mining projects with six clear phases.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning based Automated Product Billing and Inventory</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were imposed to stop the spread of the virus. As a result, the shopping malls, retail stores and grocery stores had to be shut down leading to significant losses. Though online shopping is always an option, buying daily groceries online is not a feasible option due to delivery times. As the world is now recovering from the pandemic, people have now started visiting malls, retail stores and other places for buying grocery items. In such situation it then becomes very crucial to help people shop more efficiently to reduce the buying time. This will help to keep the crowd under control without jeopardizing the safety and social distance norms. The major problem with most top retail stores is that the customer must wait in long queues after buying their products for getting them billed and payment. This puts pressure on the management and billing staff as well as makes the process of shopping a time consuming and unpleasant experience for the customer. The other issue is that most retail stores waste a significant area of their shop in setting up the billing counters and furthermore also must recruit people for running the billing counters. This project proposes a way of solving the above-mentioned problems and issues with the help of a smart shopping cart. A cart with built in billing and product scanning system which will prepare the bill as the customer is shopping, thus saving customer's valuable time, area of the shop and eliminating the need for recruiting employees for billing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimization Study of Sorting Center Volume Prediction Based on LSTM and Simulated Annealing Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study focuses on the problem of cargo volume prediction and employee scheduling optimisation in the sorting centre of e-commerce logistics network. By establishing an LSTM-based cargo volume time series prediction model and a linear integer planning staff scheduling model, combined with an annealing simulation algorithm, accurate cargo volume prediction and staff scheduling optimisation are achieved in the sorting centre. The results show that effective cargo volume forecasting and staff scheduling strategies can significantly improve the operational efficiency and reduce the cost of e-commerce logistics network. This study provides effective decision support and guidance for the optimisation of e-commerce logistics network.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>There are now an absurdly large number of available products as a result of the expansion of e-commerce, making it challenging for customers to find and choose goods would enjoy. To assist customers in finding items that suit their interests, online shops have turned to recommender systems. Traditional recommender systems do, however, have constraints that AI and Big Data Analytics can get beyond. This study uses AI and Big Data Analytics to forecast customer preferences for online buying.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Rising Trends of Smart E-Commerce Logistics</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Smart Logistics (SL) offers a competitive advantage for e-commerce by utilizing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as IoT, AI, Blockchain, Cloud computing, 5G, etc. This technology automates, optimizes, and enables real-time tracking and monitoring of shipments, predicts, and prevents delays, and optimizes delivery routes and schedules. It also provides greater visibility and control, allowing e-commerce businesses to react quickly and efficiently to changes in demand or supply. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of digitalization on trade logistics in e-commerce, emphasizing the significance of smart logistics for the e-commerce industry. We reviewed 288 articles published in the last decade in the Scopus database to assess the maturity of research in this area. For researchers, this study provides a better understanding of smart e-commerce logistics and identifies research gaps in the literature. For e-commerce professionals, it can help them adopt the latest technological trends in their logistics. Through a systematic literature review and network analysis approach, the study has contributed by identifying 5 clusters related to ICT application fields in e-commerce and 5 clusters related to important ICT enablers in smart logistics. We also identified several research gaps and areas for future study, including the underutilization of computer vision technology and the need for further research on product quality inspection and accessibility for people with disabilities. Additionally, we suggest exploring the power of deep learning to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and optimizing sensing data volume for minimizing costs associated with data storage and transfer. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in smart logistics for e-commerce and serves as a guide for future research in this field.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Advanced Imaging Technologies With Ensemble Learning for Consumer Products Identification and Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Consumer product recognition involves utilizing computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) systems for identifying and recognizing numerous consumer goods in video or image frames. This technology determines applications in retail, e-commerce, security systems, and inventory management. The purpose is to automate the detection of certain products or objects in visual data, streamlining several procedures and improving efficacy. Deep Learning (DL), implementing structures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), automates the detection and classification of consumer products in images or video frames. Trained on diverse datasets, these techniques learn intricate features, benefiting retail and e-commerce by enhancing inventory management and improving the shopping experience through automated product detection. This study develops a honey badger algorithm with ensemble learning for consumer product identification and classification (HBAEL-CPIC) technique. The goal of the HBAEL-CPIC technique is to detect and classify various kinds of consumer products accurately. To accomplish this, the HBAEL-CPIC technique employs a non-local means (NLM) filter to eradicate the occurrence of the noise. Next, the HBAEL-CPIC technique follows the capsule network (CapsNet) model for the feature extractor process. Meanwhile, the hyperparameter tuning of the CapsNet approach has been carried out using the HBA. At last, the ensemble of three models namely extreme learning machine (ELM), descriptive back propagated: radial basis function (DBRF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) are used for classification. To highlight the improved detection solution of the HBAEL-CPIC technique, a series of experiments were performed. The comprehensive comparison study of the HBAEL-CPIC technique exhibited a superior accuracy value of 96.56% over other DL approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Measurement Index System and Empirical Study of Consumers' Continuous Trust on Social E-Commerce Platforms-Based on the GA-BP network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Basing the research context on cross-border social e-commerce, this paper selects activity, online communication, social relationships, shared vision, content quality of merchants' posts and consumer purchase frequency to measure and predict consumers' continuous trust. The entropy weight method (EWM) is used to determine the weights, and the results show that two indices-social relationships and consumer purchase frequency - have a greater impact on the establishment of consumers' continuous trust. Based on the data from Wotobuy crawled using Python, this paper builds a consumers' continuous trust model based on the GA-BP neural network and conducts an error test. The results confirm the rather high accuracy of the model and suggest that it can be practically useful in the field of social e-commerce trust model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Logistic Regression based Machine Learning Technique for Phishing Website Detection</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, many people start switching from offline to online to save their precious time. They started buying products online and made their payments through online transactions across websites. These online buyers are asked to provide details such as their name, address, location, passwords, and other essential bank details on that particular website. The unaware online buyer got caught in these sites, which leads to a process of phishing. They are called phishing websites. This research work has proposed an efficient prediction method based on the machine learning technique to analyze and predict these phishing websites. Novel classification algorithm and techniques are used to analyze and extract the datasets that might maliciously cause phishing. The essential traits are helpful to identify these types of phishing sites such as domain, URL and encryption technique of a website while detecting malicious data. This research work will use a logistic regression algorithm for detecting the phishing website. A logistic regression algorithm is used to provide better performance than the traditional classification algorithm. To protect user sensitive information and for effective, secure transaction payments, many E-commerce enterprises are using this application to stay on the safer side.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sentiment Analysis of Consumer-Generated Online Reviews of Physical Bookstores Using Hybrid LSTM-CNN and LDA Topic Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Physical bookstore is the leader of cultural trend, the carrier of national reading and the provider of public cultural services, which embodies the cultural soft power of a city. The widely use of Internet e-commerce platform and the change of people's reading habits have brought great impact on physical bookstores, resulting in poor overall profitability of physical bookstores. In order to realize the sustainable development of physical bookstores, we mine and analyze consumer-generated online reviews. In this paper, a method of sentiment analysis based on Hybrid LSTM-CNN (Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory-Convolutional Neural Network) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model is proposed. Firstly, the Hybrid LSTM-CNN model is used to classify reviews, and then LDA topic model is used to extract features of positive and negative reviews. The results show that Hybrid LSTM-CNN model has better performance than the classic LSTM and CNN in sentiment classification. The LDA model mines that consumers have the positive attitude towards the products, context and ambiance of physical bookstores, and the negative attitude towards price and service. This method studies consumer-generated online reviews in physical bookstores from two aspects: sentiment classification and topic mining, which can help physical bookstore operators to know consumer feedback in time.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Virtual Dressing Room Using Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Clients Fashion in the twenty-first century has become intertwined with daily life, varying based on factors like physical stature, gender, and social context. Despite the rise of online shopping, the traditional in-store experience remains dominant, but challenges like limited fitting rooms and privacy concerns persist. To address this, our aim is to develop a highly realistic virtual dressing system, leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). This system predicts the semantic layout of a reference image, determines whether to generate or preserve image content accordingly, resulting in lifelike try-on experiences. Through virtual reality, customers can explore a wide array of clothing items without physically wearing them, saving time and effort. Moreover, retailers stand to benefit by streamlining inventory management and conserving space.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The swift expansion of e-commerce has prompted the creation of advanced recommender systems to augment user experience and boost sales. Machine learning techniques have become fundamental for the development of these systems, allowing firms to provide tailored product recommendations based on customer preferences and habits. This research presents a thorough literature assessment of machine learning methodologies utilized in recommender systems, emphasizing their predictive efficacy in the e-commerce sector. We analyze essential methodologies, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid models, and sophisticated techniques such as deep learning. Through the examination of 38 research in the domain, we elucidate the limitations, advantages, and possibilities of machine learning algorithms in delivering precise and scalable suggestions. Our research indicates that hybrid models, which integrate many recommendation strategies, demonstrate significant potential in addressing challenges like the cold start problem and data sparsity. The report delineates prospective research avenues, underscoring the necessity for continued innovation in the integration of machine learning into recommender systems to improve accuracy and customer happiness in e-commerce settings.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An AI-Enabled Centralized Monitoring System to Predict SME Inventory Level</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Adapting to the fast changes of the market along with the dynamic environment and customer demand, creates a very competitive marketplace for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Such a technology-driven market requires impulsive and viable action to enable the service providers to stay on track and follow the flow. It is very important to know the market demand and movement, which are not monthly but daily and are responses to the immediate demand. Artificial intelligence enables SMEs to observe the market demand, record the movement, and learn from it. Continuous tracking and learning of changes will enable the machine to predict upcoming patterns. This is helpful as it enables service providers to know what product or service is in demand for each specific month and even further for each specific week and day based on cumulated data and then be prepared for it. This paper proposes an AI-enabled centralized monitoring system to help SMEs observe, track, and predict upcoming market demands. The system uses hybrid learning with the help of historical data to come up with a trend and prediction following the observation of customer behavior.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Best Seller Rank (BSR) to Sales: An empirical look at Amazon.com</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The market size of e-commerce continued to grow in recent years. Amazon, a leading technology company that provides reliable online marketplaces had attracted more than two million active sellers with over 600 million active products listed on it in a snapshot in 2019. The Amazon Best Sellers Rank (BSR) is an important indicator of how well the listed product is sold and it is a common interest to all sellers. This research investigates the algorithm for setting BSR on Amazon by developing a python-based web scrapper to collect hourly data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) server. A BSR to sales mapping study is performed using a machine learning regression algorithm. The study would help Amazon sellers to understand the mechanism of BSR and its impact on future sales.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Decision-Making Approaches for Complex Applications using Deep Learning Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Decision-making (DM) is the domain that can develop any type of application. Applications such as health care systems, popular product prediction on e-commerce applications, filtering of spam emails, the behavior of the user based on online purchases, etc. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are mainly used to find complex patterns from several domains. Disease prediction is one of the tasks that can work on various diseases to predict accurate diseases according to the given dataset. This task can work efficiently on text data and image data. Many image datasets such as CT scans and MRI images are used to detect the tumors from the brain scan images. Tumors are many types and all the tumors are not cancerous and some tumors are noncancerous. Deep Learning (DL) is the domain that can work better on complex datasets such as decision making. This research is mainly focused on developing the decision-making in several domains such as disease prediction, E-commerce sites, predicting autonomous vehicles (AVs), etc. The performances of several algorithms are also shown in this work.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning on Retail Stores for Customer Churn</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The pace at which customers discontinue engaging in commercial activity with a corporation is known as customer churn, and it frequently indicates discontent or competition. Machine learning analyzes customer data to identify patterns, predict churn, and personalize retention strategies. It enables businesses to target at-risk customers and enhance engagement through tailored interventions and offers. A public dataset gathered from Kaggle is used in this research work. Exploratory data analysis is carried over to understand the patterns and trends in the churn rate. The bivariate analysis is held to find the correlation of each feature against the churn rate. With these observations, the importance of marketing strategies is exhibited. Additionally, four distinct models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and the XGB Classifier-are used to train and assess the dataset. From the evaluation of all four models with the help of the ROC score, the XGB is found to outperform and provide better results obtaining 98% accuracy and a 1.00 ROC score.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Effective Analysis of Predicting Clothes types in E-commerce reviews using CatBoost Algorithm with Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Catboost algorithm is superior to the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost) method in terms of its ability to generate predictions about the sorts of clothing based on evaluations from online retailers. This study contains 2 groups: Novel Catboost algorithm and Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier, where each group is iterated for a sample size of 10 calculated using the ClinCalc software with 0.05 as the alpha value, and a CI of 95%. The e-commerce reviews dataset with a size of 23485 was considered from Kaggle.com. The novel catboost algorithm accuracy is 92%, which appears to be superior to the XGBoost classifier's accuracy of 89%. It can be concluded that there exists a statistically significant distinction between the CatBoost algorithm and the XGBoost classifier algorithm. This is evidenced by a value of p=0.007 (Independent sample t-test p&lt;0.05) in the SPSS statistical analysis prediction of clothing types based on e-commerce reviews.. Conclusion: In analysing various clothes types by E-commerce reviews the CatBoost algorithm results show better than the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Forecasting and Analysis of Online Orders Rejections Using Data Mining Algorithms and Penalty Function</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The direction of products and food delivery from online stores and similar transportation services have become especially relevant in recent years in connection with the rapid informatization of society, and especially because of quarantine restrictions due to the worldwide pandemic. However, along with increasing demand, online stores and individual couriers often incur significant financial losses due to customer rejection of orders, disruption in preparation, or other resignation issues that are independent of the company. Therefore, the article presents a way to partially reduce financial and time losses by analyzing preliminary order statistics, identifying potential dependencies and, consequently, predicting future customer rejection based on order details. Given the large number of statistics, it is advisable to use the tools and paradigms of data mining, two different approaches are considered and compared. At the same time there is a problem of false positive conclusion of the model, due to which the system ignores the profitable orders. To reduce such losses, the use of the method of penalty functions is proposed, which allows to assess the model risks and possible benefits. The described approaches were tested on a large real sample, and the corresponding results are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Product Review Sentiment Analysis by Using NLP and Machine Learning in Bangla Language</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this era of internet technology, in Bangladesh, online marketing or e-commerce businesses were already thriving. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as people are in lockdown, online shopping became the main platform for shopping as it is the safest way. It accelerated the businesses to come online. More online product service providers makes it better for people but also raises the question of product quality and services. So it is easy for new customers to get scammed while shopping online. Our goal is to make a system that will analyze the customer’s feedback from online shopping and provide a ratio of the positive and negative feedback written in Bangla from the previous customers using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We have collected over 1000 feedback and comments on the product to conduct the research. We used sentiment analysis along with some classification algorithms like KNN, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Logistic Regression. With the highest accuracy of 88.81%, SVM outperformed all the other algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Artificial Intelligence in Marketing Management: Enhancing Customer Engagement and Personalization</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Marketing can use artificial intelligence (AI) to your advantage. It makes it easier to create intricate and sophisticated algorithms, expand the number of data and info sources, and improve software's capacity for data management. Brand-user interactions are changing as a result of AI. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to process and comprehend data without the need for explicit programming. In order to shed light on their functions in providing individualised experiences, this article explores crucial machine learning methods including clustering, content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and predictive modelling. Examining real-world applications across a range of industries, such as retail, social media, email marketing, and e-commerce, highlights successful implementations. The essay examines the disadvantages, including concerns over algorithmic biases and data privacy. Even while it concentrates on the advantages, such as higher conversion rates and happy customers.The paper addresses the moral dilemmas raised by highly customised advertising and looks ahead to new developments like reinforcement learning and natural language processing. Last but not least, this paper offers great study on how ML techniques have altered personalised marketing, which can assist companies in adjusting to the ever-changing landscape of engagement with consumers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>BRevML: Classifying Bangla Reviews for E-commerce using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, people are showing eagerness for expressing their opinion on online products, tourism services, E-governance services through social networking sites, blogs, e-commerce websites, and etc. In every second, tremendous amounts of data are being produced on these platforms. Currently, 265 million native and non-native speakers across the world use Bangla as their communication language. As a result, digital content with Bangla texts in WWW is growing very rapidly. Nonetheless, due to its complex syntactic structure and an inadequate number of Bangla tools for Natural Language Processing, research on extracting meaningful information is becoming a challenging area for researchers. In this paper, we contribute by providing a prediction model through a comparison based study for classifying positive and negative Bangla reviews. To do so, at first, we’ve accumulated a substantial dataset consisting of e-commerce reviews, written in Bangla language. We’ve applied various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression Classifier, Multinomial Naive Bias, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Four separate feature engineering techniques are applied to identify the best case. Furthermore, we’ve also applied state-of-the-art deep learning techniques such as ANN, GRU, and LSTM. Finally, we provide a comparative result through the rigorous experiment. We declare Support Vector Machine algorithm along with character-level feature extraction as effective means to classify polarity of Bangla e-commerce reviews since this combination achieved 89% F1-score in our experiment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Evaluation of Generative-AI Fashion Images using CNN Classification and Regression</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the fashion industry has the potential to revolutionize design processes, enabling the generation of diverse designs based on user inputs. Despite the promise of AI, the unpredictable quality of outputs and the challenge of meeting human aesthetic and market standards remain significant hurdles. To address these issues, this research aims to (1) create a dataset of AI -generated fashion images labeled with customer rankings, and (2) establish a new evaluation method from the perspectives of the general public and the market. Data were collected from fashion e-commerce websites focusing on customer ratings and product images. Two CNN models were trained: one for regression, predicting continuous aesthetic scores, and another for classification, categorizing images into discrete rating intervals. Performance evaluation revealed that the regression model, constrained by clip techniques, maintained the original distribution of data while the classification model provided a benchmark for design indicators. The study concludes that addressing data imbalance and applying augmentation techniques yielded significant results. Specifically, the regression model achieved an RMSE of 0.866, while the classification model attained an accuracy of 93%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Review Helpfulness Prediction Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Gated Recurrent Units</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product reviews are one of the most important types of user-generated contents that are becoming more and more available. These reviews are valuable sources of knowledge for users who want to make purchasing decisions and for producers who want to improve their products and services. However, not all product reviews are equally helpful and this makes the process of finding helpful reviews among the massive number of similar reviews very challenging. To address this problem, automatic review helpfulness prediction systems are designed to classify reviews according to their content. In this study, a deep model is proposed to utilize content-based, semantic, sentiment, and metadata features of reviews for predicting review helpfulness. In the proposed method, convolution layer is used for learning feature maps and gated recurrent units are employed for exploiting sequential context. The results of comparing the proposed method with five traditional learning methods and two deep models trained on the same types of features shows that the proposed method outperforms other methods by 4% and 2% in terms of F1-measure and accuracy. Moreover, results reveal that both textual and metadata features are important in detecting helpful reviews. The findings of this study may help online retailers to efficiently rank the product reviews.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Intelligent Review Classification for Trustworthy E-Commerce: Improving Product Recommendations with Sentiment Analysis and Fraud Detection</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Internet business has become a fast-growing industry, and though online buying has not always kept pace with this expansion in the past, its potential is finally being realized. Sentiment analysis has been a prominent topic of study within text mining. Opinion and sentiment extraction from natural language is a challenging task. Yet, sentiment analysis is a good solution, offering useful insights for decision-making in many fields. There are many techniques for sentiment detection, each impacting the quality of the results. This paper proposes to evaluate consumers' sentiments on e-shopping services through reviews, ratings, and emoticons. The main purpose is to identify fake reviews based on user and product IDs to aid in making a well-informed purchase decision and to find the best products. For this, we use a hybrid learning algorithm that analyzes diverse feedback about services. A word-level score calculation is done using a text mining algorithm, and the sentiments are then classified as negative, positive, or neutral. This method helps identify fraudulent reviews on the website. Finally, we aim to predict fraudulent reviews entered by users and ensure that only verified purchaser reviews are taken into account, while duplicates are also checked using user and booking IDs. Genuine reviews are given higher priority for product recommendations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Identifying Deceptive AI Reviews: A Machine Learning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In today's digital age, online reviews greatly influence what people buy. However fake reviews or reviews generated by Artificial Intelligent tools by using the Natural Language Processing models cause a big problem. They mislead the consumers in judging a product. This paper aims to address the issue by using machine learning to predict if a review is real or fake. A labeled dataset containing product reviews was chosen from Kaggle. It was preprocessed and then used to train three models using three different algorithms which were Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Classifiers and Logistic Regression. The best one chosen based on evaluation metrics was Support Vector Machines. This model was then used to test reviews of some top products scraped from the Amazon website. The results show the capability of the model in detecting deceptive reviews.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture is one of the most vital sectors in India which faces daily challenges due to lack of market access, poor allocation of resources and insufficient provision of timely information or crop health. This paper proposes a solution through the help of an AI enhanced digital marketplace connecting farmers directly with consumers and buyers, thus ensuring fair trade and improved profit. The marketplace integrates advanced AI tools for crop recommendation and disease prediction for further assisting farmers. The disease prediction feature leverages ResNet-50, trained on a large dataset from Kaggle, to detect plant diseases and provide preventive measures. Through fine-tuning the model achieved an accuracy of 99.17%. Furthermore, the model could successfully predict diseases for unseen data as well. This overall approach aims to empower farmers in our country and provide a better livelihood to them.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting Early Reviewers on E-Commerce Websites</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-Commerce websites have emerged in recent times for the users to share their opinion on the product received by them by posting reviews. Machine learning techniques are very useful for analyzing the customer reviews in e-commerce websites. These days, a large number of people look for computerized retailers, like Amazon and Yelp. The main objective of this work is to characterize &amp; predicting early reviewers for increasing the product sales. Previous Studies shows how early reviewers rating's and their scores impact the product popularity. Subsequently, in this paper, with the use of begin and final time datasets along with product review time span. We have proposed Algorithm for predicting Early Reviewers using Margin Based Embedding Models and Product Embeddings. The outcomes showed the algorithm can predict early reviews and applied various classifiers for the same. Naive Bayes and SVM Classifier have been best performing among all.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sales Volume Forecast of Sports Fashion Clothing Based on Machine Learning Algorithm A LGBM-SHAP Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The forecast of sales volume is of great significance to the development of e-commerce. In this paper, a sales forecasting model based on LGBT and SHAPE algorithm is proposed. The LGBT model is used to train the forecasting model, and the SHAPE model is used to quantitatively analyze the contribution of each feature, which not only retains the good forecasting effect of machine learning, but also improves the interpretability of the results. Based on the daily frequency data of a sports brand, this paper finds that the prediction effect of the model is very good, and the model also finds out that the transaction conversion rate, the number of visiting users, the page views and the average price of a single product are the main factors affecting sales, which provides some reference for improving the explanatory power of the machine learning model in finance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>PromotionLens: Inspecting Promotion Strategies of Online E-commerce via Visual Analytics</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Promotions are commonly used by e-commerce merchants to boost sales. The efficacy of different promotion strategies can help sellers adapt their offering to customer demand in order to survive and thrive. Current approaches to designing promotion strategies are either based on econometrics, which may not scale to large amounts of sales data, or are spontaneous and provide little explanation of sales volume. Moreover, accurately measuring the effects of promotion designs and making bootstrappable adjustments accordingly remains a challenge due to the incompleteness and complexity of the information describing promotion strategies and their market environments. We present PromotionLens, a visual analytics system for exploring, comparing, and modeling the impact of various promotion strategies. Our approach combines representative multivariant time-series forecasting models and well-designed visualizations to demonstrate and explain the impact of sales and promotional factors, and to support “what-if” analysis of promotions. Two case studies, expert feedback, and a qualitative user study demonstrate the efficacy of PromotionLens.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Analysis of Behavioural Data of Customer for the E-Commerce Platform by using Machine Learning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This research analyses the effect of numerous factors that allow E-commerce platforms to obtain previous knowledge about customer purchase tendencies. This research improves customer behaviour, product discoverability, and warehouse maintenance. Demanding product categories assist maintain the warehouse and generate sales ideas by offering an appropriate discount to attract consumers and promote same-day delivery. The system uses an e-commerce company database to store consumer purchase information. Our model analyses the data to classify customers and commodities. Our study includes descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to anticipate e-commerce sales. The descriptive study includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to analyze gender, city tier, spending money, age, city, marital status, financial position, brand cost, and product categories these are the attributes of dataset. To advance to predictive analytics, machine learning techniques such as naive Bayes classification, support vector classification, logistical regression, decision tree, KNN classification, and random forest classification are applied to the dataset to anticipate product sales. This proposed research reduces e-waste and promotes sustainable development by anticipating product sales.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Emergency Transportation and Structural Prediction and Optimization of Goods Based on ARIMA and Multi-objective E-commerce Logistics Network Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of the internet, online shopping has gradually become a popular way of shopping among the general public, which in turn poses a greater challenge to the e-commerce logistics network. Predicting the volume of goods for each logistics site and route, and establishing a model for quickly adjusting the network in response to sudden situations can save logistics network costs and improve its efficiency. Therefore, this article has done the following work: first, it establishes an effective logistics network volume prediction model; second, for the two scenarios of network structure that cannot be modified and can be modified, it provides a model that can effectively guide the adjustment of the volume of goods on each route when a logistics site is closed; finally, it establishes a logistics network evaluation model to evaluate the importance of logistics sites and routes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>GNN-GMVO: Graph Neural Networks for Optimizing Gross Merchandise Value in Similar Item Recommendation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Similar item recommendation is a critical task in the e-Commerce industry, which helps customers explore similar and relevant alternatives based on their interested products. Despite the traditional machine learning models, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), by design, can understand complex relations like similarity between products. However, in contrast to their wide usage in retrieval tasks and their focus on optimizing the relevance, the current GNN architectures are not tailored toward maximizing revenue-related objectives such as Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), which is one of the major business metrics for e-Commerce companies. In addition, defining accurate edge relations in GNNs is non-trivial in large-scale e-Commerce systems, due to the heterogeneity nature of the item-item relationships. This work aims to address these issues by designing a new GNN architecture called GNN-GMVO (Graph Neural Network - Gross Merchandise Value Optimizer). This model directly optimizes GMV while considering the complex relations between items. In addition, we propose a customized edge construction method to tailor the model toward similar item recommendation task and alleviate the noisy and complex item-item relations. In our comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we show higher prediction performance and expected GMV for top ranked items recommended by our model when compared with selected state-of-the-art benchmark models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research of Product Data Measurement Mode Based on Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the evolution of traditional brick and mortar retail stores to online shopping, consumers are posting reviews directly on product pages in real time. We ultilize the RBF network to predict the sales number. We construct a GM (2,1) model to predict the sales of hair dryers, microwave ovens, and pacifiers in the next five years. The state transfer probability between positive, neural and negative reviews is built. The GINI correlation coefficient method is applied to determine whether the reviewer s attitude has a strong relationship with the star rating. The innovation of this article is that we build a comprehensive model with neural network, Markov and GINI correlation coefficient. Besides, Pearson correlation coefficient is used to test the GINI correlation coefficient which make the result more complete.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Demand Prediction of Consumer Intention to Buy Edible Items Using Machine Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture is a process of simplifying the food chain in nature and redistributing the resources for animals and plant production. It is the process of nurturing livestock and growing crops. It consists of preparing animal and plant items for human consumption and distributing them to marketplaces. A maximum number of textiles and food items in the world are produced by agriculture. In India, the primary source of income is agriculture. Various companies buy crops from the farmers and directly sell them to the consumers. As per a study by “The India Express”, there are 90–150 million farmers who rely on agriculture to run the expenses of their daily lives. Each day there is a huge amount of vegetable waste as their demand doesn't get predicted due to which a volume of vegetables gets rotten. So to deal with this issue, there is a need for the development of an automated model which can accurately predict the demand for vegetables for the next day based on the previous data. In this work, a framework has been developed for predicting the demand for okra and tomato for the next day, so that the farmers won't pluck too many vegetables and also keep track of daily sales. We have used four machine learning models namely, linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression for identifying the demand for vegetables. In this experiment, two parameters %error and accuracy have been taken which shows that the decision tree model performs best with the highest accuracy of 99.62% and logistic regression has shown the least accuracy at 85.62%. This work can help various edible-based eCommerce companies for predicting the demand for the items for the next day based on the previous data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting User Preferences with Neural Network Learning to Rank Method</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>User preference learning has been around for many years. This is a common problem arise in e-commerce system, where the companies need to understand their customers in order to sell the correct products to their target customers. The user preference is also needed in the movie domain area, as the film companies who produce the movie also need to understand how the customers value their movie products, whether the market like it or not. This can help them to predict the best components for the future movie. In order to produce the recommendation to the customer, we can show a list of item in a correct order, sorted from the most relevant/the most liked one to the most irrelevant item. In this paper, we utilize the Learning to Rank (LTR) approach from information retrieval domain area to learn the user preference in recommender system domain. We applied LTR with pairwise approach from the two most popular algorithms in this area, i.e. RankNet and LambdaRank, on 25,345 user ratings from 5,000 movie dataset and evaluate both algorithms. We used a Neural Network architecture as the learning mechanism. We also measuring the speed performance of the two algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Technique for Forecasting Future Market Movement Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Because of the advent of vast realities, the practise of deep reading to foresee financial charges and patterns has gained even more traction. We structured limited stock market data sets, provided fully customizable capacity designing, and thorough dominating-based recreation to estimate the value change of stock company sectors. The suggested method integrates a customised deep learning-based device for stock commercial centre rate pattern anticipation with several functions designing approaches and pre-processing the dataset of the stock market marketplace. We performed indepth evolutions with widely used models based on machine learning, and we proved that the offered solution is superior because of the meticulous function-design work we put into it. For predicting trends in the stock market, the gadget achieves a very high level of accuracy. By carefully preparing for and evaluating projected time, developing features, and re-processing methods of data, the proposed work adds to stock inspection and focuses on local region within the financial and specialist industries.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Next-Gen E-Commerce Platform: Merging Vendor, Inventory, and Payment Gateway Solutions</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This research outlines the creation of a contemporary multi-vendor e-commerce platform that leverages data analytics, advanced payment solutions, and artificial intelligence for customer support. The platform is designed to integrate various vendor systems, facilitating centralized oversight of sales, inventory, and customer interactions, while employing real-time analytics to support informed decision-making. Built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technology stack, the platform aims to offer a cohesive shopping experience across diverse vendors, implementation includes a Chatbot Assistance feature that enhances customer support by providing real-time responses to frequently asked questions, product-related queries, and order issues. This paper discusses the technical features of the platform, the challenges encountered during its development, and the potential of data-driven strategies to enhance operational efficiency within e-commerce frameworks. To ensure the platform functions effectively, basic testing would typically be performed, such as checking order processing, inventory updates, secure transactions, and chatbot assistance for smooth user interactions, with the goal of significantly improving experiences for both vendors and customers in multi-vendor settings.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI-Driven Software Reuse: Optimization and Comparative Performance Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Software reuse improves productivity and ensures that there is less time delivered to the market by enabling the proper usage of reusable code from the software repositories. The study provides the collaboration between the AI techniques, which includes Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict software components' reusability. The comparative analysis shows the effectiveness of different AI- driven algorithms, where CNN has shown the highest accuracy of 92%, thus reducing the human effort in finding the reusable modules. The Case studies in e-commerce and health care show the benefit of using AI-driven reuse of software; this means that the development time is reduced by 25%, and the maintenance cost is decreased by 20%. The paper highlights how different AI algorithm integration with software engineering has some limitations. The findings show that AI has greatly revolutionized software reuse. Thus bringing innovation and efficiency in software engineering.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Evaluative study of cluster based customer churn prediction against conventional RFM based churn model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Churn prediction in retail industry is a very critical measure as retention strategies play a crucial role in any successful business model. In the era of e-commerce and customized customer solutions, it is essential for businesses to be on their toes to predict the changes in customer behavior as early as possible in their life cycle. RFM analysis is one of the age old techniques that have proven to be an accurate measure of customer behavior and although it aids in customized targeting, it also requires time to amass enough data. It sometimes means that by the time the business collects substantial data about a customer to make strategic decisions, they are already half way through their change in interests or behavior. Therefore, it is essential to study the possibilities of predicting future states of a customer well in advance. This study focuses on evaluating the accuracy of Machine Learning Models in predicting the churn of retail customers based on their k-means clusters against their actual RFM features. This evaluative comparison would help to establish how reliable it is to utilize a model's results to feed another predictive model and its further applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI Integrated Recommender System for Improving e-commerce Experience</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With a broad range of applications for users, recommender systems (RSs), which are made to provide individualized content, have become a crucial technological answer. Despite the fact that numerous RSs have been created and successfully used in various domains, traditional AI-driven RSs continue to encounter difficulties such as data sparsity, cold start problems, and diversity maintenance. By combining artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence (HI), augmented intelligence (AuI) makes up for their shortcomings while maximizing their individual strengths. It has been demonstrated that combining artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence (HI) improves each technology's capabilities and produces better results than utilizing each technology alone. Recommender systems, which provide predictions for a variety of goods to help consumers with personalized suggestions, have grown in popularity and usefulness. These systems guarantee that they provide users with useful and efficient help by concentrating on particular item categories and utilizing strategies intended to produce tailored recommendations. Particularly during the COVID-19 lockdown, online material streaming has become the most popular kind of entertainment in recent years. Prominent streaming services use a variety of product recommendation techniques to draw customers in and make content recommendations that suit their tastes, which increases user retention. Several recommendation systems are used by well-known streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu to improve user experience. However, serious problems including the first-rater dilemma, data sparsity, and computing complexity frequently cause these systems to struggle with accuracy and consistency. In information science, security issues have emerged as a crucial subject of user discourse. E-commerce is becoming increasingly popular as a fundamental part of the Information Science framework. Ironically, though, people are growing more cautious as security and privacy risks increase. Notably, the banking sector has entered a new era as a result of e-commerce, which has changed its services and operations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Feature Engineering Approach for Tree-based Machine Learning Sales Forecast, Optimized by a Genetic Algorithm Based Sales Feature Framework</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the new retail era, the sales pace and consumers’ consuming habits are disrupted dramatically by e-commerce and mobile consuming market developments and become various, volatile, and complicated. In sales forecasting, tree-based machine learning algorithms are popular and impressive. Feature engineering, on the other hand, is the most significant impediment to blending business and technological knowledge. An innovative way to solving the feature engineering problem of employing tree-based algorithms in sales forecast is proposed in this work. And a genetic algorithm is presented to enlarge the feature base and to explore potential values from features. To ensure that features with important business characteristics are picked, a novel feature framework for sales forecast is offered. Also given is a genetic algorithm for expanding the feature base and exploring potential values from features. The performance of tree-based models from AutoGluon will next be evaluated using a public dataset, Kaggle Rossmann sales data. The results suggest that the proposed strategy can improve the accuracy and stability of decision tree algorithms in sales forecasting significantly.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning Models in Customer Behaviour Prediction: A Comparative Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Understanding and predicting customer shopping behaviour is essential for enhancing user experience, optimizing marketing strategies, and increasing sales in e-commerce. This study compares various machine learning models to forecast customer behaviour patterns using a dataset of customer demographics, purchase frequency, and product preferences. K-Means clustering identified distinct customer segments, which were utilized as the dependent variable for classification tasks. We evaluated K-Nearest Neighbours, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Classifier, and Random Forest in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These ML algorithms have been evaluated and their performance in customer behaviour prediction is compared. The feature importance analysis identified the main factors affecting customer behaviour, enabling more effective targeted marketing strategies. This paper emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate models for behaviour prediction and offers a framework for e-commerce analytics. Comparative analysis of customer behaviour through different ML models has been evaluated on which, the Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models has given better performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. Our results indicate significant variations in model performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness compared to KNN and SVC.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Review-Based Recommender System Using Outer Product on CNN</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The expansion of the e-commerce market has led to the challenge of information overload, necessitating the development of recommender systems. The recommender system aids users in decision-making by suggesting items that align with their preferences. However, conventional recommendation models rely solely on quantitative user behavior data, such as user ratings, and lead to limitations in recommendation performance due to the sparsity problem. To address these issues, recent research has leveraged convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract and incorporate semantic information from user reviews. However, several prior studies have a disadvantage in that they fail to account for the intricate interactions between users and items directly. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, the Review-based recommender system using Outer Product on CNN (ROP-CNN) model, which adeptly captures and incorporates semantic features from reviews to address the complex interactions between users and items using CNN. The experimental results, using real user-review datasets, demonstrate that the ROP-CNN model outperforms existing baseline models for prediction accuracy. And this study presents a novel theoretical and methodological perspective in recommendation research, suggesting a method that integrates user preference information from reviews into recommender systems by leveraging rich user-item interaction information.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Clothing Size Prediction in E-Commerce: A Machine Learning Approach for Improved Customer Experience</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Clothing and apparel companies face high rates of returns due to customers ordering incorrect sizes. This can be frustrating for customers and is a waste of time and resources for the company, as they have to process the return and potentially restock the item. Uncertainty about fit also deters online purchases, impacting sales. Most currently available systems can predict the size based on all measurements provided by the customer, but that is not always feasible. This brings a need for the integration of Machine Learning to solve this problem of predicting sizes and provide better results with increased accuracy. This paper presents a thorough evaluation of various ML models for size prediction, namely Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree models. The results indicate that our model showcases considerable promise for enhancing sizing accuracy, with the Random Forest and Decision Tree models achieving noteworthy accuracy scores of 0.99 in shirt size prediction. In the realm of pant size prediction, these models maintain their effectiveness, with an accuracy score of 0.89 and 0.82, respectively. This underscores the potential of our ML model to alleviate sizing woes in the clothing retail industry.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sales Forecasting of Overrated Products: Fine Tuning of Customer’s Rating by Integrating Sentiment Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Enhancement of the profitability of any business organization is driven by proper forecasting. However, this is challenging as many factors affect the forecasting and the degree of relevant factors changes over time. Henceforth, it is essential for any business organization to develop a reliable and consistent sales forecasting model that can drive their growth. In today’s business environment, customer ratings play a pivotal role in evaluating business performance, particularly in online retailing. These ratings provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of a product or service. The rating values are generally a set of integer values within a given range. This policy restricts users from expressing their views as they may wish to give a value that is not an integer. Hence, the system fails to capture the actual view of the customer about a certain product or service. As the intermediate values (decimal values) are not permitted, customers are generally compelled to round up their ratings, resulting overrating products. This problem can be addressed if textual reviews from the customers are recorded and these are analyzed for judging customers’ satisfaction level. In this research work, we compute customer satisfaction by analyzing the review text of each customer for a particular product by using VADER sentiment analysis tool and use this result for tuning the actual user given ratings. A novel model is proposed to consider the tuned average customer rating amalgamating with standard forecasting methods like ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM. The experimental results on the Amazon dataset reveal 10% to 96% improvement in forecasted values for different types of products.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimizing Customer Experience in Online Shopping: A Hyperparameter Tuning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>After buying a product, the majority of buyers don't leave reviews, ratings, or comments, which makes it difficult for any e-commerce site to function. If a business can forecast whether a customer will like or dislike a product, it can use that information to suggest other comparable products and make decisions about whether or not to sell a certain product. This study's main goal is to forecast customer happiness with a product, which may be done by projecting the review rating that a client will provide after making a purchase. Using our dataset, we evaluate each classifier's performance using hyper parameter tuning procedure. Grid Search CV method is used with five machine learning algorithms— Naive Bayes , Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boost Decision Tree (GBDT) to find the customer satisfaction . The results showed that, GBDT outperforms the rest of the model with highest accuracy of 86.57. While both random forest and logistic regression perform reasonably well, but GBDT is more resilient to outliers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Effective Product Recommender System using Hybrid FastTex, Attention and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender system (RS) is a machine learning model to support consumer in online shopping. RS responsible to show essential product/item to customer. A variant of RS that adopted in many e-commerce businesses called Collaborative Filtering (CF). CS calculated connection between user and item using previous activity of user. RS framework that leverages past customer action, such as ratings, to provide recommendations. Unfortunately, we have collected a relatively small number of customer ratings that are below 4%. An implicit factor model is a type of matrix factorization-based CF that generates rating predictions. However, depending exclusively on matrix factorization would result in a recommendation that lacks accuracy. Product review records are utilized in various models to enhance the accuracy of rating predictions. Most individuals utilized the TF-IDF method, which is an LDA methodology, to analyze texts pertaining to product reviews. However, the standard models such as TF-IDF and LDA had limitations in terms of their ability to accurately understand the content of the document. This work employed probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) to generate rating predictions by incorporating word sequential contextual representation through the use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Attention. The contextual portrayal utilized Fasttext to convert word vector representation, each in their own way. The average values for Hybridization PMF, Attention, and Fasttext were 0.880691. Furthermore, our Hybridization PMF, Attention, and Fasttext achieved an average score of 0.7246844. Our model demonstrated a superior performance over the earlier studies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Reviewlogy: An Interface for Analyzing Sentiments</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper investigates the impact of early reviews on product sales by analyzing the traits of initial reviewers on major e-commerce platforms. It segments product life-cycles into three phases: early, majority, and laggards, focusing on early reviewers who post reviews during the initial stages. The paper introduces an innovative interface for sentiment analysis to identify and predict early reviewers. Quantitative analysis reveals that early reviewers often provide more insightful comments and give higher overall ratings. Their ratings and helpfulness scores significantly affect product popularity. The methodology, tested on extensive datasets from Amazon and Yelp, extracts crucial attributes of early reviewers, including purchasing patterns and social impact. The interface employs a hybrid machine learning approach combining Naive Bayes, margin-based embedding ranking models (MERM), and support vector machines (SVMs) to predict potential early reviewers accurately. This approach balances probabilistic reasoning with robust classification, ensuring comprehensive forecasting. Evaluation metrics such as precision and accuracy demonstrate the effectiveness of the models over baseline methods. Furthermore, the study enhances the understanding of how early reviews influence consumer behavior and product success in e-commerce. The interface aids in refining product marketing strategies by enabling precise targeting of early reviewers, accelerating product adoption, amplifying sales, and optimizing marketing tactics in the competitive e-commerce landscape.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>FashionCook: A Visual Analytics System for Human–AI Collaboration in Fashion E-Commerce Design</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Fashion e-commerce design requires the integration of creativity, functionality, and responsiveness to user preferences. While AI offers valuable support, generative models often miss the nuances of user experience, and task-specific models, although more accurate, lack transparency and real-world adaptability—especially with complex multimodal data. These issues reduce designers' trust and hinder effective AI integration. To address this, we present FashionCook, a visual analytics system designed to support human–AI collaboration in the context of fashion e-commerce. The system bridges communication among model builders, designers, and marketers by providing transparent model interpretations, “what-if” scenario exploration, and iterative feedback mechanisms. We validate the system through two real-world case studies and a user study, demonstrating how FashionCook enhances collaborative workflows and improves design outcomes in data-driven fashion e-commerce environments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Product Price Optimization using Least Square Method</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Now-a-days, company’s products in market are a multi-billion-dollar industry, largely responsible for giving products to its customers at a reasonable price in business. Optimization makes us to choose a best decision between various decision alternatives. Price, Quantity are the important measures which are fundamental to determine every business in setting up the right price. Price Optimization is the most important decision that a company can make for their products. Being a product Under-priced disappoints the company, getting Over-priced hurts the consumers and can lead to loss if they are less inclined to buy the product at a higher price. we will deal by integrating the company’s production operations and the pricing strategies. A company must manage its production properly and set the price to the product ensuring in such a way that a customer is willing to pay price for the product. The main idea is to make prices of products that a company can make best meet with its objectives such as profit, sales, etc. In this Paper, we will try to implement a correct pricing using the data that we have and describe a scalable, online, real-time, updated price optimizer implementation of product price optimization that can be seen for maximizing revenue.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Using Word2Vec Recommendation for Improved Purchase Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Purchase prediction can help e-commerce planners plan their stock and personalised offers. Word2Vec is a well-known method to explore word relations in sentences for sentiment analysing by creating vector representation of words. Word2Vec models are used in many works for product recommendations. In this paper, we analyse the effect of item similarities in the sessions in purchase prediction performance. We choose the items from different position of the session, and we derive recommendations from selected items using Word2Vec model. We assess the similarities between items by analysing the number of common recommendations of selected items. We train classification algorithms after we include similarity calculations of the selected items as session features. Computational experiments show that using similarity values of the interacted items in the session improves the performance of purchase prediction in terms of F1 score.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Pay-Close-Enough-Attention Ensemble Classifier for Spotlighting Bogus Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As a result of the proliferation of social media platforms and online shopping, an increasing number of individuals are sharing their shopping experiences on the internet and relying on the opinions of their contemporaries to direct their decision-making when it comes to making purchases. The growing reliance that people place on reviews to help them make judgments about the products and services they buy online has contributed to an increase in the number of instances in which reviews have been falsified. The accuracy of classification in the traditional method is dependent on the label dataset, which is not only challenging to collect and analyze, but also slow, laborious, and reliant on the participation of a human in the form of feature extraction. The length of the text that may be found online makes the model less sensitive to irregularities since the classifier is more likely to overlook important facts. We provide an attention-based semi-Ensemble Classifier as a solution to the problem that was stated before. This classifier is designed to detect fake reviews. Deep neural networks use both labeled and unlabeled data to properly learn input distributions, which ultimately results in enhanced prediction accuracy for online reviews. One way that this is accomplished is by automatically identifying the features that are required for classification. The application to the labeled data set provided by TripAdvisor highlights both the efficiency of the method’s attention mechanisms in the classifier for acquiring an adequate semantic representation and the method’s dependency on a limited training set for identifying false reviews. The results of the trials show that the suggested system can detect fake reviews with a higher level of accuracy than the state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithms, even when the label dataset is very limited.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Comparison of ARIMA, LSTM, XGBOOST and Hybrid in Stock Price Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting the closing price of stocks accurately is a complex and challenging task in the stock market. The value of studying stock price forecasting is helping investors make wiser decisions and increasing their chances of investment success. Despite the uncertainty and volatility in the stock market, in-depth research and analysis can provide clues to predict stock price fluctuations. This article explores the applications of the ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, and Hybrid models in predicting the closing prices of six companies in six industry sectors: technology, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, e-commerce and online services, financial services, consumer goods, and telecommunications. By applying these four models to each company, the accuracy of stock price prediction can be improved, and practical guidance can be provided to investors to optimize financial profits. Empirical results indicate that the ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, and Hybrid models have specific effects on the financial technology industry's stock price prediction. Among them, LSTM has slightly higher prediction accuracy than ARIMA. The Hybrid (Attention-based XGBoost) model performs best among all six companies. However, stock price prediction based solely on historical data and market trends is inaccurate. Therefore, investment decisions need to consider multiple factors comprehensively to achieve better returns.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Smart Commerce: Unleashing Machine Learning for Optimal Customer Experiences</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology which address on the usage or application of data and Algorithms to emulate the style that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. By understanding this statement humans are not associated with machine learning, once the system is deployed by them. Once the whole system is installed in the software through algorithm or coding, the machine adapts the order and continues accordingly without hindering little things like Sleeping, fatigue like humans and can work for long time and can operate it 24/7, with repetition. But the system must be kept up-to-date. E-commerce or electronic commerce is the trading of goods and services, or transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily in internet. In this paper, we will explore the crucial role that machine learning plays in the e-commerce sector, highlighting its impact on various aspects of digital commerce and its importance for organizations in the contemporary business landscape.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A study on the E-commerce Trends using Data Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Over the years, numerous businesses transitioned to creating online access, which helped them towards gaining access to a global presence. With the rise of ecommerce businesses accessed through websites or social media platforms, many seemed to have failed to generate sufficient revenue for themselves. Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science have aided retailers in managing their supplies, creating a brand for themselves with the review system, and providing the customer with recommendations. Moreover, with the help of these recommendations, customers have made the right choices when purchasing a product. Thus, this is what all established retailers and their customers demonstrate. Due to a massive increase in e-commerce businesses, it is significant to have details of all the ongoing strategies in the current business to ensure a reasonable growth rate. This study will interpret the different trends, platforms, and strategies involved in an ecommerce business.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Bayesian Deep Learning Meets Self-Attention: A Risk-Aware Approach to Advertisement Optimization</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the highly competitive landscape of e-commerce advertising, maximizing Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) is critical, yet remains inherently uncertain due to auction-based bidding dynamics and fluctuating market conditions. Traditional deterministic models fail to capture this uncertainty, necessitating a probabilistic approach that balances predictive accuracy with interpretability. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Bayesian Deep Learning framework that integrates a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) for structured probabilistic reasoning and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) for full distributional modeling of ROAS. The BBN models dependencies among campaign variables, offering interpretable insights, while the hierarchical deep learning architecture overcomes scalability limitations in high-dimensional settings through self-attention mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate up to 22.8% lower RMSE and 27.4% better Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) and up to 31.2% lower Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) than state-of-the-art methods (DeepAR, Prophet, NGBoost), achieving an R2 of 98% with an inference speed of 5.2 ms per campaign, making real-time bidding feasible. Ablation studies confirm that attention-driven feature selection and calibrated uncertainty quantification significantly enhance both predictive performance and explainability, identifying key drivers of campaign success. By providing precise, uncertainty-aware, and explainable predictions, this approach enables adaptive bidding strategies, optimized budget allocation, and risk management, setting a new benchmark for intelligent decision-making in digital advertising.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Purchasing Prediction Model Considering the Time Consumers Spend on a Site and Consumers Characteristics (Second Report)</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the proliferation of the Internet, retailers are obtaining large amounts of big data such as access logs and customer attributes from their daily online interactions with customers. By using those data, retailers can understand the characteristics of the customers who visit their sites, and can tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. Specifically, by building a purchase prediction model, a model that predicts which customers will visit a site and make a purchase and which will not, it is possible to understand what factors are influencing customer purchases. Traditionally, one such model has been built using data such as POS data and customer attributes, focusing only on the resulting purchases by customers. However, since those models fail to take into account the process by which the customer makes the purchase, they are unable to understand what the customer was thinking when he or she made the purchase. In e-commerce, which is a transaction via the Internet, it is possible to obtain data on the process of a customer's purchase, such as how much time the customer spent on what product, what products the customer browsed before making a purchase, etc. By using these features in the model, it will be possible to gain a more precise understanding of the factors influencing the customer's purchase. The purpose of this study is to construct a purchase prediction model that incorporates variables that indicate the time spent on the site by customers, the time spent browsing products, and the bias of the time spent on the products browsed by customers, and to obtain the contribution of the features to the prediction results to help formulate marketing strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Virtual Fit Trail: Revolutionizing Size Recommendations and Enhanced Shopping Experience</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Digital technologies have merged with fashion retail to provide innovative online shopping solutions. These virtual solutions have several studies showing AR-based visualization and size recommendations as the main focus. But existing solutions are often said to lack adequate personalization, real-time adjustments in fit, and seamless integration of ML models within AR-enabled shopping experiences. This paper reviews the Virtual Fit Trial Application, the outcome of previous research integrating some of the CV technologies with an AR use case and ML size prediction models. This system has an intuitive web interface that allows the users to select apparel, get detailed suggestions on size, and inspect garments virtually in AR and 3D, this overcomes the disadvantages of previous studies and improves customer satisfaction, thereby keeping lower return-to-stock rates, and mixing the physical shopping experience and the digital one. This work explains how the development of augmented reality-supports virtual fitting rooms, along with ML size recommendations, will reshape the world of e-commerce, providing a trustworthy and engaging shopping experience.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In current times, transportation is crucial. Transportation assists us in our activities. Hence, the people are interested at alternatives such as used cars. In a transaction, product knowledge is important, yet used one for cars is uncommon. After the lift of distancing rule, interest in transport rose. Our purpose is to find how useful a predictor will be in Indonesia for providing the public of knowledge in secondhand car prices. The algorithm aims to help users to market used cars at the right price, preventing fraud. During the study, SMOTE is used to cover for the lack of sample of the dataset. The methods, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to predict the price of used cars and compare its results based on the RMSE, MSE, MAE, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Score. To add, we have chosen an ensemble learning method, XGBoost. With the usage of the above methods, results in the price of the cars not being a simple outcome with set variables being applied with each transaction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Demand Prediction of Agricultural Crops using Artificial Intelligence</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) greatly depends on agriculture. The major risk in the agriculture field, now-a-days is price volatility. The constant fluctuation in price on daily basis makes farmer strain to prepare a marketing as well as farming plan. Many factors contribute to the mutation of prices specifically climate changes, merchant fee, variation of prices based on regions and attack of pesticide. The farmers are not aware about the financial funding schemes in conjunction with their eligibility given by the government for their welfare. The existing software applications does not support all regional languages which does not make feasible for farmers to use the application. The application concentrates on creating a user-friendly application that could predict day-to-day trends of cost in the market and helps the farmer to gain profit for their goods. To achieve this, Machine learning. Algorithm – Decision tree algorithm is used to predict the price of agricultural products with respect to inflations and deflations in market. The proposed idea mainly focuses on predicting the price using machine learning algorithm by using certain parameter (Data set) namely season, location, seed sales, histogram and etc., for specific agricultural product. The system uses Global Positioning System (GPS) which helps to select the location to predict price and to find the nearby marketplace for auctioning of agricultural goods. For easier accessibility for farmers, they can choose their regional languages for better understanding.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>fProSentiment Analysis on Mobile Phone Brands Reviews using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Due to the rapid growth of online e-commerce, customers can now voice and express their reviews and thoughts on online products. Therefore, companies who market their product on the e-commerce website will receive thousands of reviews and feedback from their end-users directly on this platform. As the amount of textual data grows tremendously, developing sentiment analysis that automatically analyses text data becomes increasingly vital. It is because reading every review manually can be a tedious task and time-consuming. Analyzing the sentiment for all reviews can provide the companies with an overview of how positive or negative the customers are about their products. The convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently been used for text classification tasks and has achieved impressive results. Hence, this study proposes a CNN method for sentiment analysis to classify the reviews on mobile phone brands. The customer reviews dataset is obtained from the Amazon website. This study combined the Word2Vec-CNN model to predict the sentiment of mobile phone reviews effectively. Pre-trained Word2Vec model is utilized to generate word vectors in word embedding. CNN layers are used to extract better features for sentence categorization to identify the sentiment polarity of the reviews, whether positive or negative. The obtained results give us 88% accuracy and the developed application can also function well in analyzing the sentiment of customers’ reviews.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Purchase Intent Forecasting with Convolutional Hierarchical Transformer Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Purchase intent forecasting, which aims to model user consumption behavior over different categories of items, plays a key role in many services, like online retailing systems, computational advertising and personalized recommendations. While the recently emerged deep neural network models (e.g., recurrent neural network, or attention mechanism) have been proposed to understand user’s sequential behavior, we argue that the successes of these methods is largely rely on the data sufficiency. However, the practical purchase forecasting scenarios involve highly sparse data distributions across categories and time. In such cases, one has to deal with the data imbalance problem in order to encode the complex patterns of user purchase behaviors. To tackle this challenge, we develop a Convolutional Hierarchical TRansformer networks (CHTR), to enable the purchase pattern modeling with the multi-grained temporal dynamics, so as to alleviate the data imbalance issue. In our CHTR framework, we develop a multi-grained hierarchical transformer network, to make the learned behavior embeddings be reflective of the multi-level relational structures. Then, a dependency modeling component is proposed to aggregate the multi-relational context signals and capture the underlying dependent structures. Our experiments on real-world datasets show the significant improvements obtained by CHTR over different types of alternative methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Explainable AI: Leveraging SHAP for Transparent Decision-Making in Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, the swift progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has resulted in to impressive performance across various domains, but the opacity of complex models, often referred to as “black-box” models, has raised concerns regarding trust and interpretability. This paper addresses these challenges through Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), focusing on Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret a predictive model built on an online retail dataset. The research employs Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to predict customer repeat purchases and uses SHAP to provide clear insights into the model’s decision-making process. SHAP effectively identifies key features such as TotalPrice, UnitPrice, and Quantity as the most significant factors driving the model’s predictions. TotalPrice was found to be the most influential feature, demonstrating its strong association with repeat purchases. The analysis reveals that the total price of items purchased is the most significant predictor of repeat purchases, with a SHAP value of 0.45, indicating a strong positive correlation. Additionally, unit price and quantity also play important roles, contributing SHAP values of 0.32 and 0.20, respectively The model achieved an accuracy of 85%, with a precision of 0.78 and a recall of 0.80. These results indicate a robust performance in predicting repeat purchases. Furthermore, the research highlights that consumers from certain countries demonstrate distinct purchasing patterns, influencing overall sales performance. These insights empower retail managers to identify critical variables and adapt marketing strategies accordingly. The analysis not only enhances model transparency but also ensures that the predictions align with business expectations, allowing stakeholders to trust and act on the model’s insights.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sentiment Analysis with Soft-Voting Method on Customer Reviews for Purchasing Transactions of E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The accuracy of customer reviews is crucial for an e-commerce platform to assist buyers in selecting high-quality products from a vast array of options. This research aims to develop a sentiment analysis model for evaluating customer opinions expressed in e-commerce product reviews. The proposed approach utilizes the Soft Voting (SV) technique, which demonstrates superior accuracy compared to the conventional Sentiment Selector (SS) method. The sentiment analysis model’s accuracy is determined by gathering probability values from three classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB)) for each sentiment category (positive, neutral, negative). The evaluation is conducted using the Tokopedia product review dataset. The findings indicate that the Soft Voting (SV) model outperforms the Sentiment Selector (SS) approach. The proposed SV model achieves an accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of 69%, 70%, 69%, and 69%, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Role of Artificial Intelligence in Influencing Impulsive Buying Behaviour</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This research paper investigates the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on impulsive buying behaviour in the digital commerce domain. The study explores how AI algorithms, data analysis, and customized marketing approaches influence impulsive buying decisions, reshaping traditional understandings of this phenomenon. The analysis draws from a confluence of psychological principles, technological advancements, and marketing strategies, aiming to shed light on how AI not only forecasts but also incites impulsive buying behaviours. The study identifies research gaps, such as the integration of AI with emotional triggers, the comparative effectiveness of AI vs. human influence, and cross-cultural and demographic variability. The research methodology involves a descriptive study with a questionnaire-based survey, and data analysis tools such as ANOVA and paired t-tests. This research contributes to the broader discussion on digital-age consumer behaviors, underscoring the revolutionary role of AI in transforming retail experiences and beyond.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>WSN-Assisted Consumer Purchasing Power Prediction via Barracuda Swarm Optimization-Driven Deep Learning for E-Commerce Systems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The conventional e-commerce business chain is undergoing a transformation centered on short videos and live streams, giving rise to interest-based e-commerce as a burgeoning trend in the industry. Varied content stimulates the fast growth of interest in e-commerce. By employing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to collect real-time data on user behavior, preferences, and contextual factors, businesses employ high-tech analytics and predictive modeling systems to evaluate individual purchasing power. This new integration supports E-commerce platforms to offer personalized and targeted product recommendations, pricing strategies, and promotional campaigns, thus optimizing the customer shopping experience. The WSN-assisted predictive abilities not only allow businesses to tailor their offerings to particular user segments for contributing to the overall performances and effectiveness of E-commerce ecosystems in a gradually dynamic market. This study develops a WSN-Assisted Consumer Purchasing Power Prediction via Barracuda Swarm Optimization Algorithm Driven Deep Learning (CP3-BSOADL) for E-Commerce Systems. The major aim of the CP3-BSOADL technique is to precisely forecast the procuring power level with the customer content preferences to offer new concepts for interest e-commerce systems. In the CP3-BSOADL technique, two major processes are involved. For the prediction process, the CP3-BSOADL technique utilizes a stacked auto-encoder (SAE) model which effectually forecasts the purchasing power of the consumers for e-commerce systems. Besides, the BSO algorithm can be applied to effectually fine-tune the hyperparameters related to the SAE model which leads to accomplishing enhanced predictive results. The performance analysis of the CP3-BSOADL technique is tested using an e-commerce dataset. The extensive result analysis stated that the CP3-BSOADL technique gains better performance over other recent state-of-the-art approaches in terms of distinct measures.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Consumer Behaviour Analysis for Customer Segmentation and Purchase Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, is the practice of placing orders online or negotiating a sale's terms and price. Although e-commerce is often associated with selling products and services to consumers, business-to-business (B2B) transactions also make use of it. To market their goods, many smaller consumer enterprises rely only on online sales. Nowadays, people are choosing to make purchases online as online transaction mechanisms and shopping platforms develop. Nevertheless, given that both clients and Merchants are unable to interact with clients face-to-face, there is a limited understanding of consumer demands. Due to this, businesses may struggle to gauge nuanced cues such as body language and personal preferences. Limited direct engagement can hinder the ability to address specific customer needs and preferences, potentially resulting in misinterpretation or overlooking crucial details. In turn, businesses may face difficulties in tailoring their products or services to meet the nuanced expectations of their customers, emphasizing the importance of alternative strategies such as detailed customer feedback mechanisms and data analytics to bridge this gap. The online system logs user activity and gathers data on consumer behaviour, allowing for the prediction of consumer purchasing patterns. Therefore, to improve the shopping experience of people, our study aims to use historical sales data to analyze consumer behaviour and do customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) based K-means clustering and purchase prediction using various ML models to improve sales, out of which the combination of Logistic Regression and XGBoost performed the best.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Construction of E-Commerce User Profile Design Model Based on Deep Learning Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In rural e-commerce platforms, user behaviors are complex and diverse, and it is difficult for the recommendation system to accurately predict demand, resulting in a low conversion rate of the platform. Based on deep learning, this paper uses deep learning models, that is, models, to analyze user browsing, purchasing, and feedback behaviors, and optimize recommendation algorithms. The research process mainly includes user portrait design and model construction, model description recommendation and optimization, system integration, and application. According to the experiment, the recommendation accuracy of the rural e-commerce user portrait recommendation system increased by 20% or more, and the purchase conversion rate increased by 44.23%. It can be seen that deep learning, especially the recommendation system, can significantly improve the user experience and sales performance of rural e-commerce platforms, especially in personalized recommendation and real-time feedback optimization. On the whole, deep learning can show good performance and high application value in the rural e-commerce recommended user portrait.</dcterms:abstract>

It has revolutionized the way business and consumers interact with each other in buying goods and services commonly used today. E-commerce involves different online deals, including retail shopping, banking, investments in stock markets and ample of other basic commercial procedures that the consumers can move from their comfort zone. This study checked the level of shopper fulfillment on e-commerce in Bangladesh by product reviews. This was done by conducting it in a dataset of 6964 events classified into three categories &quot;satisfied&quot;, &quot;not-satisfied&quot;, &quot;highly satisfied&quot;. Based on the wide variety of models as presented, this research paper iterates using SVM, LR and random forest among other standard Machine Learning Techniques i.e., Standard Machine Learning technique (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Classifier etc. to discover and predict customer sentiments. The Random Forest (RF) classification achieved a better result than standard, with 94% accuracy in learning complex patterns of Bangla product reviews and predicting customer satisfaction effectively. Transparency and ethical aspects of methodology guarantee validity and generalization. Further research, therefore on long-term analyses, international comparison and new technologies are needed to explain the structure of customer satisfaction in the changing e-commerce environment especially in Bangladesh. This study will be helpful for the investigators, developers and politicians who want to enhance user experiences and methods in the competitive growing e-commerce market of Bangladesh.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on a Hybrid Prediction Model for Purchase Behavior Based on Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, online retail has maintained rapid growth, and websites are rich in user behavior data. The operation behaviors of users on the e-commerce platform can reflect user preferences. How to use user behaviors to mine user preferences has become the focus of academia and industry, and many research results have been achieved. In many cases, by fusion training two or more different algorithms, the generalization ability of the algorithm can be significantly improved to improve the prediction effect. This paper combines the fusion of logistic regression and support vector machine algorithms to construct a hybrid prediction model for user buying behavior, and conducts an empirical study on the effectiveness of the model. The empirical results show that the fusion model has better prediction effect than the single model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Blockchain-Integrated Machine Learning Framework for Detecting Fraud in E-Commerce Returns</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-Commerce fraudulent returns pose significant challenges, resulting in substantial financial losses and damaging reputations. This study proposes a hybrid framework for fraud detection, combining blockchain-based rule validation with machine learning models to enhance accuracy and scalability. The framework integrates predefined blockchain rules with machine learning predictions using Random Forest and Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q-Networks with experience replay) for a layered approach to fraud detection. Blockchain smart contracts dynamically verify transaction attributes and user behavior, while the machine learning models adapt to evolving fraudulent patterns. Experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement in accuracy, precision, and recall, alongside a reduction in false positives compared to standalone methods. By leveraging customizable blockchain rules aligned with organizational policies and periodically updating machine learning models, the proposed framework offers a scalable, secure, and adaptive solution for mitigating fraudulent returns in e-commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Bengali Sentiment Analysis of E-commerce Product Reviews using K-Nearest Neighbors</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The sentiment analysis of the Bengali language is converting into a trendy research topic nowadays. Sentiment analysis is a useful technique in opinion mining, emotion extraction, and trend predictions. By sentiment analysis, the actual sentiment of a text review can be extracted. Every day, every second's people use the internet for different purposes and leave their opinions or perspective views in various places on the internet as a text format. The opinion or review on the internet can contain the author's positive, negative, and neutral views of the statement. This study proposed a machine learning-based model to predict a user's sentiment (positive, neutral, and negative) of a Bangla text review. We have applied five machine learning algorithms in our dataset, which we manually gathered from a Bangladeshi e-commerce site called “Daraz.” We have experimented with Random Forest classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost algorithms with our dataset. KNN performs great among all these five algorithms in all the performance measures of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. KNN shows 96.25% accuracy, 0.96 in each of precision, recall, and f1-score.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Fuzzy Approach to Purchase Intent Modeling Based on User Tracking For E-commerce Recommenders</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender systems play a vital role in e-commerce by presenting personalized product suggestions, reducing habituation and leading to transactions in an environment with limited human touch. Data used for learning how to select optimal recommendation content, including mouse tracking data, are often imprecise in nature. In this paper, we present a fuzzy approach to model purchase intent based on tracking user interaction with a browser via mouse and keyboard. It appreciates data uncertainty and provides insights into e-commerce customer behavior and the development of shops online. The developed fuzzy rule-based systems had a good accuracy and low interpretability, and results show that to generalize possible purchase intent with fuzzy rules, it is good to begin with looking at such behavioral features as distance of mouse movement, distance of vertical page scrolling, number of mouse clicks and time of user activity on website in relation to page content length. In future work, we intend to look at more features reflecting product parameters and transactions to enhance the modeling results on a larger scale.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Personalized Learning in E-Commerce Platforms with Collaborative Filtering and C Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To enhance substantiated literacy within e-commerce platforms, this exploratory study investigates the possibility of integrating cooperative filtering with deep literacy using several methods. Because of the complexities of individual preferences and the ever-changing trends, traditional recommendation systems typically have difficulty properly predicting the preferences of stoners. The combination of cooperative filtering, which makes use of stoner-item relations, and deep literacy, which processes massive volumes of data to discover detailed patterns, work together to provide a stoner experience that is more refined and tailored to the individual customer. The suggested method seeks to overcome the constraints of traditional recommendation systems by providing product recommendations that are more accurate and appropriate. This is accomplished through the integration of several methodologies. This study demonstrates the efficacy of cooperative filtering and deep literacy emulsion in perfecting substantiated literacy issues in e-commerce settings. As a result, this study contributes to advancements in stoner satisfaction and engagement within online retail environments. The study was conducted through trial and evaluation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Consumer Perspectives for Purchase Intentions of Online Pharmacy Products Using Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, online business models have been developed due to the availability of low-cost, high-speed internet. Online pharmacies using e-commerce sites now can reach to their customers easily and sell medications online. It is easy for customers to evaluate prices and product reviews before purchasing medicines. To understand the factors that affect consumers' behavioral and purchase intention from online pharmacies, a modified UTAUT model was used to investigate five determinants related to adoption intention namely perceived trust, perceived risk, perceived ease of use, performance expectancy, and social influence. This research delves into the viewpoints of online pharmacy customers, specifically examining the effects of deep learning algorithms. With their unparalleled accessibility and ease of use, internet pharmacies have revolutionized the healthcare industry. If these digital platforms are to be optimized for user happiness and optimal operation, it is crucial to understand how people perceive and interact with them. Customers now have more alternatives than ever before for getting their medications, Most prediction models' inputs were determined to be criteria pertaining to online activities and behaviors. Various deep learning techniques are used in purchase intention prediction because of their superior capacity to manage complex and massive datasets with little to no human oversight. The predictions using CNN and LSTM models achieve a high level of accuracy and are studied in our model with a modified framework for purchase prediction using these algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI Driven E – Commerce Product Recommendation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce is growing in today's world, and if you want to sell more to your customers and stay ahead of the competition, you need to keep up with online shopping trends and know what they want. In the past few years, the number of products available on shopping websites has grown by a huge amount. This leads to the problem of systems growing. Websites use a lot of data mining tools and suggestion systems, but users still might not get the best product for their search, which hurts the customer experience. Getting the search results as small as possible and combining goods from different websites can save time and improve the customer experience. Also, no shopping website has a way for customers to track prices and make predictions about them. With the help of web scraping and the Product Rank algorithm, our system tends to give customers rich and expensive goods from all shopping sites at the cheapest price of their choice without having to use human filters. With sales going up and income going up, we must also show how much we lost when we bargained with customers. Our proposed system tends to work like a smart web spider for all e-commerce sites. It scans every page for you and finds the most affordable, ideal-quality goods of your choice in actual time. This also makes sure that all e-commerce websites will be merged into a single, highly screened system. It can also make good suggestions based on what the customer wants and act as an involved player in the system. This tool can also help e-commerce companies because it can find dead pages, prices that the seller put in wrong, glitches, mistakes, and fraudulent activities on their websites in real time.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Web Phishing Detection Using Decision Tree Random Forest and XGBoost</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rise in web phishing attacks poses a critical threat to cybersecurity because they deceive users into disclosing personal information through fraudulent websites. This study compares three machine learning models for the identification of phishing websites based on important URL-based variables such as domain age, HTTPS presence, and lexical analysis: The Decision Tree provides an interpretable hierarchical classification, while the Random Forest builds resilience through multiple trees to improve accuracy and minimize overfitting. The gradient boosting algorithm XG Boost achieves substantial classification performance gains through boosting approaches [1]. The effectiveness of each model is evaluated by applying the ROC AUC analysis along with the measurements of the F1 score for accuracy, precision, and recall. ROC-AUC curves demonstrate how well each model can distinguish between phishing sites and legitimate websites. Experimental research shows that ensemble models like RF and XG Boost surpass individual decision trees in predictive capacity, which provides crucial insights for improving automated phishing detection systems. This research supports the development of reliable web security systems while highlighting machine learning as a key element in cybersecurity.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Artificial Intelligence based Smart Cosmetics Suggestion System based on Skin Condition</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Today, cosmetics have a big impact on how people look. Customers can access a range of products and conduct e-commerce on the website. Choosing the best product for our skin might be challenging. It offers a prediction approach so that individuals can select the goods that are suitable for their skin type. Configuration concepts perform better than conventional methods. It uses deep learning technology to streamline the complex procedures in the IT industry for cosmetics and beauty care. Along with its clients and product offerings, the beauty sector has grown over time. With the expansion of products and consumers, selecting the right cosmetics becomes more and more important. Due to the substantial influence that cosmetics have on a person’s appearance, the client should choose the best cosmetics for themselves based on personal factors (skin type). Given that every person has a distinct type of skin, choosing cosmetics that suit the person may be difficult. The composition depends on whether the client has oily, dry, or neutral skin. Even the product the user is looking for can have an extremely difficult skin condition; AI algorithms are perfectly suited to address this problem since they can evaluate massive amounts of unstructured data and generate insightful results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Product Recommendation System Using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A product recommendation system is a machine learning application that suggests products that users may purchase or engage with. The system uses machine learning algorithms and data about different users and products to build a complex and connected network between these products and people. Featured offers, which the company predicts will be the most important items for a given client, show up on the landing page, item pages, truck, checkout and even request affirmation pages. Based on data from previous clicks by customers. E-commerce businesses often add lists of top-selling, new, and recommended products to their lists. In addition, the advancement of recommender frameworks utilizing AI calculations frequently deals with issues and brings up issues that should be settled. In recommender systems, when the customer is on the product page, the new and modified recommendation list will be displayed as related products or other customers also bought this if they are interested in the product. Similar functionality can be extended to some extent for offline businesses. Here, advanced machine learning techniques were applied to the product dataset with excellent results. The proposal system is designed in three parts which include product honesty-based prediction, client's buy history and evaluations given by different clients who purchased similar things-based prediction and for an internet business site interestingly with no item reviews. When another client with no past buy history visits the e-shop's site interestingly, they are suggested the most well-known items sold on the organization's site. When customer makes a buy, the proposal framework refreshes and suggests different items in view of procurement history and evaluations given by different clients on the site. The subsequent part is finished utilizing cooperative sifting strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Exploring the Transformative Role of Machine Learning in Predictive Marketing: Enhancing Customer Targeting and Addressing Privacy Challenges</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Machine learning (ML) is playing a transformative role in predictive marketing. This article explores the specific applications of machine learning and the challenges it presents, how it gives businesses a competitive edge in the market, and the risks they need to manage. Predictive marketing is the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data, identify patterns, and predict future customer behavior. Machine learning plays an important role in predictive marketing. Marketers can develop personalized marketing strategies that anticipate customer behavior, reduce customer churn, and optimize deal pricing to gain a market advantage. However, certain applications of machine learning can also raise privacy and transparency issues. Companies need to comply with data protection regulations and prevent data breaches. At the same time, companies also need to pay attention to the accuracy of the data and prevent significant errors in the results of machine learning algorithms from causing serious harm to companies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sentiment Rating Prediction using Neural Collaborative Filtering</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The main purpose of this study is to examine the working of neural collaborative filtering by utilizing the user reviews. We have done this research using the Amazon Reviews dataset. E-commerce is the most well-known application of recommendation algorithms. Websites that use information about a customer's tastes to provide a list of recommended things. Sentiment analysis can help you better understand the emotions, attitudes, and views of your users. Collaborative-filtering in a recommender system is beneficial to improve suggestion reliability as it focuses on the interaction between items and users, and the similarity of two items is determined by the similarity of their ratings by users. In the paper, sentiment rating for each user review has been calculated using the Vader lexicon approach to get the polarity score and a general framework of Neural Collaborative Filtering with a neural architecture has been studied that can learn any function from the input by replacing the inner product. NCF (Neural Collaborative Filtering) is a generic framework that can express and generalize matrix factorization, train user–item interaction function and introduce a multi-layer perceptron to boost NCF modeling with non-linearity. The Mean absolute error results obtained for different models claim for the NCF to be the best approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms: A Data Science Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The widespread use of data mining is a direct result of the practice's first success in more public arenas like marketing, e-commerce, and retail. Discoveries in healthcare are among them. Data is abundant in healthcare systems. In spite of this, there is a lack of efficient analysis tools for uncovering latent connections in data. In particular, this study aims to describe the Nave Bayes and decision tree classifiers used in our research to predict cardiac events. It has been shown, through experimentation on the same dataset, that Decision Tree is more effective than Bayesian classification when it comes to predictive data mining.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Study on Amazon Product Satisfaction: Based on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customer-generated product feedback is crucial for e-commerce sellers launching new products, as it significantly impacts brand reputation and profitability. Traditionally, businesses must wait passively for such feedback, potentially wasting opportunity costs. To address this, we develop a predictive model for online product satisfaction. We employ statistical and machine learning tools, including Interquartile Range (IQR) and RoBERTa, a natural language processing model, to evaluate product satisfaction. This incorporates average star rating, review text content, number of helpful votes, and verified purchases to increase assessment accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of five product listing features-price, item weight, manufacturer, color, and country of origin-on product satisfaction. Based on these insights, we construct a multivariate prediction model with XGBoost (a popular machine learning algorithm used for prediction and classification tasks), which supports businesses in preemptively identifying market risks and optimizing product strategies right at the outset of a product launch.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimization and Evaluation Methods for Automation of E-Commerce Logistics Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, for the e-commerce logistics network of cargo volume prediction, site closure, network adjustment and comprehensive evaluation and other issues, the establishment of the corresponding mathematical model, based on the prediction results and the handling capacity of each logistics site and the transport capacity of the line to design the logistics network adjustment program, for the e-commerce logistics network for emergency mobilization and structural optimization of the problem to provide a solution. Firstly, the cargo volume of three important routes was predicted using ARIMA and LSTM models, and the weighted combination method was used to obtain the final results. Secondly, the network after site closure was optimized using simulated annealing algorithm to obtain a new line allocation scheme, and the load factor of each line was calculated. Then, the dynamically adjustable network was planned using a multi-objective dynamic decision model. Finally, the importance of each site and line was evaluated using the entropy weighting method TOPSIS model, and the change of the load rate of each line was observed under different random days and disturbance ratios, which was found to have little effect and the model was robust.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Ensemble Learning based Categorical Boosting for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction in Businesses</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction is becoming critical task for businesses to identify high-value customers and optimize the marketing strategies. However, the existing Deep Neural Networks (DNN) failed to predict CLV in business due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of customer behaviour. Hence, this research proposes an Ensemble Learning based Categorical Boosting (EL-CatBoost) to provide decision-making and strategic planning for businesses. Initially, the data is collected from online retail customer churn dataset and fed into preprocessing with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) imputation. The preprocessing technique effectively handles the missing values in the data by replacing the missing value with nearest similar one. Then, the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is employed to extract semantic, sentiment, and contextual features from the preprocessed data. Finally, the proposed EL-CatBoost is employed to predict the CLV by capturing the complex relationships within the features. From the results, the proposed EL-CatBoost achieved better results in terms of terms of Rate of Investment (ROI) with 10-day prediction (ROI-10) of 0.1803 and ROI with 20-day prediction (ROI-20) of 0.3795 when compared with the existing Temporal Structural User Representation (TSUR) network.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Log-Based Session Profiling and Online Behavioral Prediction in E–Commerce Websites</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Improvements to customer experience give companies a competitive advantage, as understanding customers' behaviors allows e-commerce companies to enhance their marketing strategies by means of recommendation techniques and the customization of products and services. This is not a simple task, and it becomes more difficult when working with anonymous sessions since no historical information of the user can be applied. In this article, analysis and clustering of the clickstreams of past anonymous sessions are used to synthesize a prediction model based on a neural network. The model allows for prediction of a user's profile after a few clicks of an online anonymous session. This information can be used by the e-commerce's decision system to generate online recommendations and better adapt the offered services to the customer's profile.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>2D Cast Shadow Generation in E-commerce Image Using UNet Vision Transformer</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>in e-commerce, the visual presentation of products plays a crucial role in attracting customers and driving sales. One important aspect of product imagery is the generation of realistic cast shadows, which adds depth and enhances the overall visual appeal. In this paper, we propose the algorithm for 2D cast shadow generation in e-commerce using version of the Soft Shadow Network (SSN) modified by UNet Vision. The proposed model can handle complex lighting scenarios and produce realistic shadows with varying degrees of opacity. The UNet Vision Transformer helps to extract and encode the features of the object and its lighting conditions to generate the shadow maps. The model is employed to refine the generated shadows and ensure their consistency with the product images. The obtained results demonstrate that the use of the transformer has a positive effect on the quality of the trained network's prediction. The technology is integrated into the system developed by us which aim is to process the images and prepare e-commerce catalogue.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>OPAM: Online Purchasing-behavior Analysis using Machine learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customer purchasing behavior analysis plays a key role in developing insightful communication strategies between online vendors and their customers. To support the recent increase in online shopping trends, in this work, we present a customer purchasing behavior analysis system using supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods. The proposed system analyzes session and user-journey level purchasing behaviors to identify customer categories/clusters that can be useful for targeted consumer insights at scale. We observe higher sensitivity to the design of online shopping portals for session-level purchasing prediction with accuracy/recall in range 91-98%/73-99%, respectively. The user-journey level analysis demonstrates five unique user clusters, wherein New Shoppers are most predictable and Impulsive Shoppers are most unique with low viewing and high carting behaviors for purchases. Further, cluster transformation metrics and partial label learning demonstrates the robustness of each user cluster to new/unlabelled events. Thus, customer clusters can aid strategic targeted nudge models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>User Behavior Prediction Model Based on Deep Learning Algorithms in the Digital Economy Environment</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Economic globalization has driven the rapid development of the digital economy, with cross-border e-commerce rising alongside it. In this context, the accurate prediction of user behavior is crucial for shaping future marketing strategies and optimizing the allocation of social resources. To address this, this paper proposes a user behavior prediction model based on deep learning algorithms. The model integrates the strengths of three fundamental models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, enhancing the overall performance. In cases where the feature matrix is extremely sparse, the model efficiently predicts user behavior by utilizing second-order feature interactions. Experimental results indicate that the importance of the predictive factors for user behavior is as follows: Product Functionality (D) &gt; Influencer Recommendations (B) &gt; User Inertia (E) &gt; Product Quality (C) &gt; Brand Image (A). Additionally, the model's normalized Gini coefficient reaches a maximum value of 0.77, with a prediction accuracy of 0.95 and a recall rate of 0.94 in both iterations, demonstrating excellent predictive performance. Overall, the deep learning algorithm-based prediction model outperforms all other comparison models in terms of accuracy, recall, stability, and generalization capability, making it the most effective model among those tested.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A DNN-Based Cross-Domain Recommender System for Alleviating Cold-Start Problem in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Many applications use recommender systems to predict user preferences, improve user experience, and increase the amount of sales. However, because of the cold-start problem, it is not easy to recommend items to new users accurately. Recommendation performance degrades in the case of users with little interaction, in particular latent users who have never used the service. To alleviate the cold-start problem, we develop a framework that combines an online shopping domain with information from an Ads platform. Our framework employs deep learning to build a cross-domain recommender system based on shared users in these two domains. This is the first attempt that models users based on shared users in online shopping and Ads domains for solving the user-cold start problem. We apply Word2Vec to turn textual information on users and items into latent vectors as their representations. The experimental results show the effectiveness of deep neural approaches with knowledge transferred from another domain for the cold-start problem. Textual information may contain useless information, and Word2Vec cannot capture some structural and semantic correlations between different users. Therefore, we propose R-metapath2Vec to enhance user modeling and use the Stacking model to integrate these two kinds of user representations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our integration model: our framework can recommend products to users of another domain through Ads distribution in a more accurate level.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Classification Of Cultivars Employing The Alexnet Technique Using Deep Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The recognition of hybrid fruits by humans is considered a challenging task as fruits exist in various colors, sizes, shapes, and textures. In the marketplace, where prediction of fruits, vegetables, and pulses by retailers and the general public is very difficult. In this paper, we have recognised two different classes of fruits, vegetables, and pulses and categorised them based on the stages of their existence and maturity in a procedure called fruit maturity classification. Crop distribution, good fruit counts, crop harvesting, crop disease detection, weed management, and production forecasting are all aspects of managing water and soil and are just a few of the smart agricultural applications that employ robust learning (DL). The finest deep learning is what this project seeks to produce in algorithms for estimating fruit quality and ripeness in order to forecast fruit shelf life. Manual vegetable and fruit detection is a hard process when done in large numbers, but it becomes easy when done in small amounts. Automated detection of these is thus used. Fruit, crop, and pulse images served as the input for the first stage of processing, which included detection. Background removal, extraction of colour and texture properties, and categorization comprised the three steps of the process. The K-means clustering method was used for background subtraction. Statistical attributes were used to pinpoint colour characteristics. This research proposes a simple and effective method for detecting fruits and predicting their nutrition information using deep Alex networks (DAN). The datasets used in the investigation were obtained from the Fruit 360 library of image processing problems. Apples, berries, bananas, grapes, papaya, peaches, avocados, and various apple tastes are among the fruit groups. The trials are also carried out on a variety of additional fruit samples gathered from various Web archives. The network design consists of three fully linked layers, including the max pooling and RELU levels, and five convolution layers. 227*227*3 photos should be used as input for 96 filters that are 11*11*3 and have a stride length of 4.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendation Ranking Method Combining Graph Convolutional Network and Factorization Machine</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of graph neural network technology and the wide application of personalized recommender systems in the industry, how to better apply graph representation learning to recommender systems to continuously improve the recommendation effect and improve the user experience has become a hot field of the industry research. Based on hot issues such as sparse feature data, cold start, and multi-feature combination in massive data, this paper proposes a personalized recommendation ranking method that combines graph convolutional network and factorization machine. The method represents the network relationship between users and items based on the graph structure and generates the graph embeddings on the hyperparameter space through graph representation learning, uses the factorization machine to combine the learning of four categories of features of user attributes, item attributes, interaction, and context, and generates the vector representation separately, and finally predicts personalized recommendation score based on the ranking model. The comparison experiments of multiple groups of ranking methods show that the ranking learning method proposed in this paper is better than the baseline in six indicators of AUC, Logloss, UV_CTR, CVR, ATV and the exposure ratio of new items on the online e-commerce data set, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>SentiTSMixer: A Specific Model for Sales Forecasting Using Sentiment Analysis of Customer</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Appropriate forecasting of sales can lead to significant revenue gains for any organization, as it allows them to plan their funding, arrange infrastructure, manage the supply chain, and anticipate profits accordingly. However, sales forecasting depends on various factors, such as product quality, market trends, economic conditions, competition, and customer behavior, and it has become even more challenging with the rise of online retailing. In today’s era, especially for online retailing, customer feedback plays a vital role in assessing a product’s quality, as users can express their level of satisfaction through it. Customers can share their opinions using numeric values, such as ratings, and/or through text, such as reviews. Additionally, they can express their views by voting on other reviews they find most helpful, based on their own level of satisfaction. In this research, we have modified the TSMixer model for sales forecasting by amalgamating customer satisfaction levels regarding a specific product. This enhancement allows the model to account for how customer sentiment directly influences sales performance, thereby improving the accuracy of sales forecasting. Experimental results on various types of Amazon data show that, depending on the dataset and the specific error detection techniques used, the proposed model delivers a reduction in error ranging from 65% to 99% compared to established models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Local Energy Marketplace Agents-based Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Establishment of distributed energy generation through the home and commercial PV applications contributed to the emergence of the energy prosumer role, eliminating the distinction between energy producers and consumers. Blockchain technology provides a different and secure energy-trading solution by automating direct energy transactions within a distributed database architecture. It leverages cryptographic hashing and consensus-based verification. This study aims to implement a versatile Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulation framework for electricity exchange to assess the capability of Blockchain technology in household power usage prediction (see Fig. 1). A robust multi-agent structure was created and simulated for Transactive Energy (TE) Distributed Energy Resources (DER) within the ECCH microgrid, using Blockchain technology. The study found that Blockchain-based Local Energy Markets (LEMs) rely on precise short-term forecasts of individual households' energy production and consumption, which are often overlooked. The study initially assessed the accuracy of energy forecasting techniques for specific households to test this assumption. The second step analyzed prediction errors under three different supply scenarios in the market. The results showed low forecasting errors in an LSTM model, which was then integrated into a LEM built on a Blockchain. The research highlights the importance of accurate time series estimation of smart meter data1.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Designing an Efficient Product Image Classification Framework Using Adaptive YoloV5 with Long Short-Term Memory in E-Commerce Platform</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Presently, the online store supports the customers to buy the desired products in online. So, huge competitions are developed in the Electronic Commerce (E-commerce) sector for developing the technology. Most of the E-commerce platforms represent the particular products that users enquire about and also display other similar objects also to improve the interest among the online customers. As the online platforms hold more variety of products, it is essential to analyze the similar products sold together, and also its recommendation is needed. Sentimental analysis plays a major role in opinion mining, which helps to enhance product recommendations to online users. Every day enormous data are generated in the E-commerce and the data are utilized by online retailers to identify customer expectations. Using enormous resources, sentimental analysis models process multiple online options. Hence, it is important to construct a new product image classification technique for the E-commerce platform by considering the limitations of existing techniques. At first, essential images are acquired from standard sources. The gathered images are provided to the product image classification phase. Here, effective product image classification procedures are executed using a developed framework named Adaptive YoloV5 with Long Short-Term Memory (A-YoloV5-LSTM). Also, the weights and hyper-parameters are tuned using Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO). Further, the efficiency of the recommended product image classification technique is validated over different performance metrics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Real-Time Detection of Fake-Shops through Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce fraud has been surging at an alarming rate, reaching an all-time high in Austria in 2019, with an increase of 32.3% since the previous year. Illegitimate subscription services, counterfeit goods and fake-shops cause consistent and enormous financial damage. Manual preventive measures fall short due to the sheer number and increasing volume of cases reported for evaluation. Reducing the window of opportunity and increasing the efficiency in flagging fake-shops is therefore key. This paper presents an approach to classify fraudulent online shops solely on the basis of the similarity of their source code structure using machine learning processes. The trained models show an Accuracy of up to 97% and a very high degree of certainty in classifying fraudulent e-commerce, with 61% of all absolute prediction values being nearly identical to the ones made by human experts. Additionally, an aggregated model was developed that plays an important factor in balancing the overall quality of predictions. The open source software components developed include the Fake-Shop Detection API and Middleware, which enables a risk assessment of any website based on the trained models. By using the developed models, the system was able to issue warnings for 48% of fake-shops at the highest prediction confidence level, meaning that these could have immediately been blacklisted by consumer protection agencies, without a single false-classification and an error rate of zero.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Ego-Aware Graph Neural Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In scientific exploration and daily life, inter-connectivity between entities is ubiquitous, such as species via the food webs, people among social networks, and products and customers in e-commerce. Graphs and networks are natural constructs to model such linkages, which can capture the relational information in addition to features provided by individual nodes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful computation tool for reasoning about interconnected data and can help us make better use of the information imbued in data collectively. GNNs have found many successful applications, such as predicting drug side-effects, classifying diseases, and predicting the function of proteins. Most existing GNN methods are designed for datasets with moderate node features, where individual node features provide limited information, and assortative graph datasets, where nodes and their neighbours are more likely to be similar. However, for graphs with rich node features, or for the disassortative graphs, where nodes and their neighbours tend to be different, the message passing process in GNNs might be susceptible to inferences from the neighbourhood, leading to performance deterioration. To address this issue, we find that ego networks contain an extra layer of information to further distinguish different ego nodes. Based on that, we propose a generic GNN model that can better utilize structural information of nodes' proximity to extract informative messages and resist contradictory ones from their neighbourhood. We analyze how node features and graph structure can influence the performance of GNN models. Experimental results provide insight on how our method outperforms the baselines. The presented model paves the way for incorporating ego networks' structural information into the learned graph representations, which brings GNNs with better performance and higher robustness over different datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Machine Learning-based Automated Approach for Mining Customer Opinion</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Amazon Reviews allows customers to review the purchased or used products. This type of user-generated content is incredibly helpful for e-commerce businesses; whether it is from existing customers or new ones, every review provides a valuable perspective and feedback on a certain product. Amazon product reviews are an incredibly powerful tool for both buyers and businesses in determining the perceived value of a product, informing decisions, and improving customer trust and loyalty. This study explores the use of machine learning-based methods to assess the sentiment of Amazon product reviews from a range of product categories, including electronics, home appliances, and fashion items. Through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning algorithms, this study aims to determine whether there is a correlation between customer sentiment and product category. The analysis will further facilitate the development of a model that can accurately predict sentiment scores for any given batch of reviews or comments. According to the study, using Text Blob, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Multinomial Naive Bayes methods can improve classification task accuracy. It produced 91% accuracy with SVM and Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes methods are 84% and 87% accuracy with on 4444 positive reviews and 469 negative reviews.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Comparative Analysis of Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering and Deep Learning Models for Resolving Cold Start and Data Sparsity Issues in E-commerce Recommender Systems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In today’s digital landscape, where online activities and e-commerce play pivotal roles, Recommender Systems (RS) have become indispensable tools for enhancing user experiences by providing personalized recommendations. However, collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms often face challenges such as the cold start problem and data sparsity. This work addresses these challenges using memory-based CF approaches such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), SVD++, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Baseline, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Basic. Hyperparameters for these algorithms are optimized using GridSearchCV with cross-validation values set to 5, 10, and 15. Additionally, Deep Learning (DL) models including LSTM, BiLSTM, Att+BiLSTM, User-Product Fusion (UPF), and Deep Collaborative Filtering (DCF) are explored. The BiLSTM model achieves a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.1224, while the DCF model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.6897. Among the evaluated models, SVD++ achieves an RMSE of 0.9881 and an MAE of 0.7003 with cross-validation set to 15, indicating superior predictive accuracy. The best performance is observed with cross-validation set to 15. These results highlight the effectiveness of optimized memory-based CF algorithms in overcoming the cold start and data sparsity issues, leading to more accurate and reliable recommendations. The findings suggest that memory-based CF algorithms, specifically SVD++, can significantly enhance the development of robust recommender systems, ultimately improving user experience in e-commerce and other online platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Predictive Analytics Approach to Brand Equity Optimization: Unveiling Consumer Insights for Masstige Marketing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the age of big data, a plethora of consumer information is available; nevertheless, leveraging this data to comprehend client behavioral preferences is a significant difficulty. A data-driven methodology is suggested to tackle critical concerns associated with masstige marketing, emphasizing price sensitivity. A machine learning framework has been established, producing a cohesive model that amalgamates transactional RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) factors, behavioral dimensions from consumer interactions, and several demographic metrics. RFM is recorded at the transactional level, while customer interactions are assessed by metrics including active seconds, product views, product searches, session participation, interaction duration, and interaction view count. Clustering techniques such as K-means facilitate the identification of analogous consumers; further labeling of the clusters assists in classification using multinomial logistic regression and in extracting behavioral traits. A 2017 case study utilizing data from a fashion e-commerce company revealed findings that warranted an investigation into predictive analytics. Five C s are delineated, and research gaps are identified concerning consumer behavior and brand identity ideas. The findings from the price sensitivity study demonstrate the importance shoppers place on unique brands and premium products. An new strategy is offered to re-engage dormant customers and augment brand equity in fashion e-commerce. The findings offer recommendations for branding and marketing strategies. Both specific and general measures were identified and analyzed using the proposed methodology.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI-Driven Sentiment Assessment and Automated Departmental Categorization for Customer Feedback</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>By allowing businesses to grasp how consumers feel about a product or service, sentiment analysis is very important to e-commerce. Companies can increase revenue by analyzing user-generated reviews to improve products and services, increase customer satisfaction, and tailor marketing strategies while also reducing negative feedback. The focus of this study is to develop a simple Python-based AI system that automatically classifies customer reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. It is also necessary to design a system that categorizes reviews based on business functions such as logistics, sales, and other departments. This section of the report outlines the benchmark measurement that evaluates the effectiveness of the models presented. The model for automatic sentiment classification achieved 94.2% accuracy, while the departments’ mapping model achieved an impressive 94% classification precision. Further, accurate models became enhanced by implementing an intuitive Python interface to increase accessibility and improve the experience of users.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multimodal Temporal Fusion Transformers are Good Product Demand Forecasters</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Multimodal demand forecasting aims at predicting product demand utilizing visual, textual, and contextual information. This article proposes a method for such forecasting using an integrated architecture composed of convolutional, graph-based, and transformer-based networks. Since traditional forecasting methods depend on historical demand and factors like manually generated categorical information, they face challenges such as the cold start problem and handling of category dynamics. To address these challenges, our architecture allows for incorporating multimodal information, such as geographical information, product images, and textual descriptions. Experiments with the multimodal approach are performed on a real-world dataset of more than 50 million data points of article demand. The pipeline presented in this work enhances the reliability of the predictions, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multimodal information in product demand forecasting.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing E-Commerce Pricing with PPO: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Pricing techniques and strategies are changing and developing within the domain of e-commerce and retail. These sectors implement differentiated pricing systems depending on market conditions, industry competition, and product or service demand. Market participants that apply a dynamic pricing technique also face challenges associated with traditional models, such as inertia, slow response to market shifts, and failure to capture complete revenue. To overcome the challenge of achieving full coverage of continuous action space and adaptable stability in a highly dynamic environment, we propose a reinforcement learning approach based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that enables continuous and granular price adjustments to enhance price optimization and maximize profit. The structure of the online store dataset is prepared to include demand elasticity, stock, and competitors' prices. The performance of the proposed PPO managed to set the correct price 91% of the time, earned 12.8 times more in cumulative rewards than DQN, and achieved lower price variability, which makes it a robust candidate for real-time dynamic pricing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Improving Explainable Recommendations by Deep Review-Based Explanations</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Many e-commerce sites encourage their users to write product reviews, in the knowledge that they exert a considerable influence on users’ decision-making processes. These snippets of real-world experience provide an essential source of data for interpretable recommendations. However, current methods relying on user-generated content to make recommendations can run into problems because of well-known issues with reviews, such as noise, sparsity and irrelevant content. On the other hand, recent advances in text generation methods demonstrate significant text quality improvements and show promise in their ability to address these problems. In this paper, we develop two character-level deep neural network-based personalised review generation models, and improve recommendation accuracy by generating high-quality text which meets the input criteria of text-aware recommender systems. To make fair comparisons, we train review-aware recommender systems by human written reviews and attain advanced recommendations by feeding generated reviews at the inference step. Our experiments are conducted on four large review datasets from multiple domains. We leverage our methods’ performance by comparing with non-review based recommender systems and advanced review-aware recommender systems. The results demonstrate that we beat baselines on a range of metrics and obtain state-of-the-art performance on both rating prediction and top- N ranking. Our sparsity experiments validate that our generation models can produce high-quality text to tackle the sparsity problem. We also demonstrate the generation of useful reviews so that we can achieve up to 13.53% RMSE improvements. For explanation evaluation, quantitative analyses reveal good understandable scores for our generated review-based explanations, and qualitative case studies substantiate we can capture critical aspects in generating explanations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Using Social Media Background to Improve Cold-Start Recommendation Deep Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recommender systems, a cold-start problem occurs when there is no past interaction record associated with the user or item. Typical solutions to the cold-start problem make use of contextual information, such as user demographic attributes or product descriptions. A group of works have shown that social media background can help predicting temporal phenomenons such as product sales and stock price movements. In this work, our goal is to investigate whether social media background can be used as extra contextual information to improve recommendation models. Based on an existing deep neural network model, we proposed a method to represent temporal social media background as embeddings and fuse them as an extra component in the model. We conduct experimental evaluations on a real-world e-commerce dataset and a Twitter dataset. The results show that our method of fusing social media background with the existing model does generally improve recommendation performance. In some cases the recommendation accuracy measured by hit-rate@K doubles after fusing with social media background. Our findings can be beneficial for future recommender system designs that consider complex temporal information representing social interests.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning as A Predictive Technology and its Impact on Digital Markets</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Machine Learning (ML) Approach is a prospective methodology that is frequently employed within global production, branding, economics, transit, and aviation today. The global banking markets of today have had a significant influence on several facets of digitized pricing. Large firms employ a variety of digitized pricing strategies to produce the highest revenue margins possible despite undertaking international commerce. On the opposite side, successful machine learning applications provide important benefits in the global digital markets. It has been determined that companies may trade revenue over digital channels more easily and at a lower cost with the usage of ML methods as they previously could. Additionally, machine learning may quickly enhance overall trade approaches in digital pricing marketplaces to increase profits and provide flexible company knowledge for upcoming experimentation. Using a supplementary approach and subject-related questionnaires, investigators will explore the research design issue with an efficient quantifiable way. Utilizing a variety of cutting-edge ML technologies to improve the effectiveness of digital pricing has gotten simpler in the current sharing marketplaces. In order to expand the area of future study, the research article provides certain significant insight into the effects of ML techniques and associated applications to digital pricing. This feature has a significant influence on and simplifies an organisation's fundamental judgement processes. However little available about managers' attitudes towards it and awareness of machine learning (ML) technologies, as well as their uptake and deployment to enhance both strategic and operational management, according to the information gaps study. This study that is being provided herein focused on how marketing departments, news businesses, &amp; advertising can use employ ML-driven tools. A sampling of all these organisations that operate in Czechoslovakia was the subject of a qualitative and quantitative study. The results highlight: 1) the significance of intelligent analytical tools in the development and application of marketing techniques; 2) the ignorance of technological innovations, such as machine learning (ML) and intelligent systems (AI); 3) The minimal degree of acceptance &amp; usage of ML-driven analysis tools in marketing, as well as 4) the prospective applicability of ML technologies in business. Thus, the aim of this paper involves discussing the concept of machine learning as a predictive technology and evaluating its impact on the digital markets. In order to achieve the research, aim and objectives, a thorough research methodology has been included in this study. At the end a brief conclusion has been drawn by considering all findings and facts together. Furthermore, to assist businesses in locating prospects &amp; carrying out initiatives focused on the application and acceptance of critical ML tools in digital advertising, a framework made up of accelerators and a flow diagram was established.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>GWO-CNN: Trust and Intelligent Recommendation system based model to improve marketing strategies on e-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In 21st century, AI-based intelligent recommendation system uses rating predictions, which are frequently utilized and helps users swiftly filter down their options and make informed judgements from an abundance of material. Nevertheless, as recommender systems only contain a small number of explicit data and are subject to cold start and sparsity issues, the majority of existing recommendation models have poor accuracy. The majority of conventional algorithms used to make recommendations simply take into account the straight-forward connection among consumers and products, largely ignoring the interests, prospective employment factors, or other social aspects of the products being recommended.In this study focus is on user preferences, as they are key to tailoring recommendations to individual needs. By combining trust values with user preferences, the system can recommend items that not only have a high trust value but also align with a user's individual tastes or needs. For this proposed model used feature matrix, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). GWO is an optimization algorithm used to find optimal weights or parameters for the recommendation system. Once the GWO has found optimal or near-optimal weights, they are integrated into the feature matrix. These weights can help prioritize or scale certain features to improve the recommendation quality. Then CNN will extract patterns and relationships from the feature matrix. Based on the processed feature matrix, the system predicts the top 'K' items to recommend to the user.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Probec: A Product hunting tool</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years the use of e-commerce platforms has increased rapidly; but unfortunately, in Pakistan, this idea still needs more exposure. Our research and project are based on a web platform related to PRODUCT HUNTING TOOL in Pakistan mainly. People do not use e-commerce platforms mostly because of the lack of ease that could be provided using product hunting tools. Our web application has a simple idea to make product hunting tools similar to the existing ones, using machine learning algorithms at the back-end. Our application will and can be used by all e-commerce sites. There are several third-party tools available for a few e-commerce platforms outside Pakistan but the concept of the Product Hunting Tool in Pakistan needs to get more fame. Moreover, not much research has yet been done on Product Hunting Tools, which will eventually become the necessity of future e-commerce. Product Hunting Tool is a tool that helps sellers in finding the right product to sell. It will help the seller in gaining more profit by understanding what the right product is. This paper focuses on different product hunting tool features and their working along with the algorithms used.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimizing Logistic Regression for Flawless Fraud Detection in Digital Payments</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rise in online transactions and e-commerce in the digital era has resulted in more fraudulent activity, which presents major difficulties for financial institutions and internet stores. Often depending on manual inspection and rule-based systems, traditional fraud detection techniques fight against advanced and high-volume fraud. the logistic regression across the real-world transaction data. Examining strategies to improve predictive power, it contrasts the performance of the model against conventional approaches and other machine learning systems. It highlights the benefits of applying the logistic regression for fraud detection, so supporting sustainable development goals including industry innovation, lower inequality, and strong institutions by means of insights and methods to help businesses protect their customers and lower financial losses.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting the Helpfulness of Online Customer Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customers rely on online reviews when making purchase decisions on e-commerce platforms. Reading the massive amount of available reviews on products is a timeconsuming process. Hence, several online platforms allow customers to vote on whether a review is helpful. However, customers may consider the helpfulness voting process hard due to the number of reviews. This research paper presents an automated review helpfulness prediction method called HelpPrd. HelpPrd adopts text mining and machine learning techniques to predict the review helpfulness. The presented approach extracts features from the textual reviews to train three helpfulness classifiers. The experimental results demonstrate that HelpPrd-logistic regression achieved better performance than other implementations of HelpPrd in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Joint Sentiment-Topic Model for Product Review Analysis of Electronic Goods</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online product review plays an important role in raising the voice of customers and their purchase decision. However, a conventional method in the area has largely focused on field research and surveys to acquire information about customer preferences. The already existing frameworks largely focus on supervised learning model techniques which is not feasible in all cases as it requires a labelled corpus which might be difficult to gather at times. This paper proposes a new framework for a review of topic modelling named joint sentiment topic model. The proposed research work extracts key features of online reviews and present a detailed analysis of different approaches and techniques, comparing the reliability of diverse systems among them. Also, this research work attempts to implement topic modelling in order to find how much a customer’s occupation and interests match a particular product and accordingly give weightage to their reviews. This idea is an effort to explore different approaches and techniques of topic modelling and provide valuable executive implications for electronic goods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Performance Analysis for Prediction of Trending Footwear Classification using DensNet compared with Logistic Regression model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of DensNet and Logistic Regression in terms of accurately predicting the classification of footwear trends.In this study, there are two groups: the Novel DensNet model and the Logistic Regression model. Each group is being iterated for a sample size of ten, which is being generated with the ClinCalc software. The alpha value is set at 0.05, and the confidence interval is set at 95%. We took into consideration the footwear prediction dataset that was available on Kaggle.com and had a size of 15854. The statistical analysis reveals a significant difference between the DensNet algorithm and the Logistic Regression model, with a value of p=0.001 (independent sample t-test p&lt;0.05). The DensNet algorithm exhibits a significantly higher accuracy rate of 94.56% when compared to the Logistic Regression model, which records an accuracy rate of 90.62%.In comparison to the Logistic Regression model, the DensNet algorithm has a higher level of accuracy when it comes to predicting the Novel Footwear Trending situation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Overview of the Literature on Sentiment Analysis Methods for Online and Social Media Platforms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid rise in popularity of social media sites and blogs, has prompted reviews and comments on daily activities. Sentiment analysis is the process of gathering and analysing opinions, thoughts, and impressions about subjects, goods, and services. SA produces accurate predictions in business and politics. Millions of bytes of data are uploaded and exchanged by people on product review sites, blogs, social networking sites and other online forums within the Internet realm that penetrates nearly every human being on our globe. Despite the numerous approaches for SA which is proposed, there is still a scope for effective methods which can reliably extract and produce correct sentiment analysis. Although there has been significant advancements made with ML techniques like SVM and Naïve Bayes, Maximum Entropy is the most notable method. This paper aims to contribute a comprehensive assessment report that can serve as a foundation for future research by surveying SA approaches and methodology.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Blockchain-based Electricity Marketplace</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The concept of &quot;energy prosumer&quot; is a relatively new phenomenon resulting from distributed energy production through photovoltaic (PV) technology, which has blurred the line between energy producers and consumers. Blockchain technology has facilitated secure and cost-effective energy transactions among consumers, prosumers, and utilities, automating the process. This study aims to develop an agent-based modeling (ABM) simulation framework for energy exchange, demonstrating the power profiles of households and the operation of blockchain operations. The simulation was conducted in the Education City Community Housing (ECCH) microgrid, using a multi-agent framework for a transactive energy (TE) distributed energy resource (DER) that requires blockchain technology. The current blockchain-based local energy market (LEM) aims to balance supply and demand using precise short-term energy generation forecasts and home consumption estimates. This study evaluated the accuracy of state-of-the-art energy forecasting methods in predicting household energy generation and consumption. It examined the impact of forecasting errors on market outcomes under different supply scenarios. Although LSTM models may provide low forecasting errors, the researchers found that the prediction process needs modification for a LEM built on a blockchain. This study stands out from previous research by forecasting the timeline of smart meters in general.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>FM-IGNN: Interaction Graph Neural Network with Fine-grained Matching for Session-based Recommendation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Session-based recommendation plays a critical role in a number of scenarios, e.g., e-commerce, which predicts user behavior based on sessions. The primary challenge is to match user interests and candidate items accurately. Existing studies mainly learn the representation of session items and candidate items independently, and aggregate session representations through an attention mechanism. Nevertheless, user interests are usually cross-domain, and the characteristics of the items are also multifactorial. Fixed session and candidate item representations lead to suboptimal matching. To some extent, it limits the representation capability of the model. In this paper, we present an Interaction Graph Neural Network with Fine-grained Matching, named FM-IGNN, for session-based recommendation. It incorporates interactive features into item and session modeling to match candidate items and user interests more accurately. We first propose an Interaction Graph Neural Network(IGNN) to learn candidate-aware session item representation and session-aware candidate item representation interactively. We then design a Fine-grained interest Matching (FM) framework to learn user interests related to candidate items, and calculate the matching scores of users and candidate items at multi-levels. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FM-IGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) schemes with a large margin. Specifically, on the Tmall dataset, it achieves relative improvement of up to 20.54%, 16.07%, 13.41%, and 15.52% on the Precision@10, MRR@10, Precision@20, and MRR@20, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Ensemble Approach on the Online Shopping Churn Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online shopping grows along with the growing population. An ensemble approach has been drawn for better shopping churn prediction. The algorithms used are KNN, Stacking, Random forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. An accurate prediction of(90.65%) has been achieved for our ensemble approach as the best result. It refers to the customers who have winded up utilizing persistently on the company's service or product. The number of customers lost within a certain time frame divided by the amount of customers who are active at the begin of the term is one way to compute churn rate. For example, if you gained 1000 clients last month but lost 50, the monthly churn rate would be 5%. Every period of month, the customer base which is active are fed into a Machine Learning best Predictive Model, which calculates the probability of each client churning, will be sorted from highest to lowest probability value (or score). Clients with a low probability of value (or, in other words, customers who has the low threshold value the model forecasts no whisk) are content customers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Examining the Forecasting Movement of Palm Oil Price Using RBFNN-2SATRA Metaheuristic Algorithms for Logic Mining</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>RBFNN with different algorithms and the logic mining method for forecasting constitute the most significant tools and techniques, which are used to demonstrate the economic growth in the country. Upon using monthly data spanning from Jan 2016 to March 2020 for the manufacturing of palm oil, the results mainly revealed that RBFNN-2SATRAAIS is the most accurate and efficient model compared to RBFNN-2SATRAPSO and RBFNN-2SATRAGA in forecasting the price of palm oil. RBFNN-2SATRAAIS had the highest average overall accuracy (90.476190%), followed by RBFNN-2SATRAPSO (85.71%), and RBFNN-2SATRAGA (76.19%). The results also showed that the spot price of palm oil is highly influenced by the total exports and imports, as well as the production of palm oil, its end-stocks, and Malaysia’s real, effective exchange rate. By using the data mining technique based on the energy minimization technique, the logical mining task was carried out. The empirical findings provided useful insights into decision-making and policy implementations, including the formulation of strategies to help the industry in dealing with constant price fluctuations and, thereby, enabling the Malaysian palm oil industry to continue its domination over the international market.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Fraud Prediction in Pakistani E-commerce Market</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With Pakistan being ranked as the 46th largest revenue generator in terms of the E-commerce industry, online frauds have increased proportionally. The process of online shopping has changed drastically as the seller and buyer can now communicate directly through social media applications without needing a specific platform. It implies that all fraud prevention techniques, already in place, fail in such scenarios as they are only applicable to their platform. So, for an easily attainable input to the fraud prevention pipeline, our research focuses on analyzing the fraudulent activities in this market by using commonly available customer, product, and seller traits, as features. For this research, a product-based fraud detection dataset was collected through a survey and various feature selection techniques and ML models were applied to it. In prospect, our approach can be used to develop a utility that automatically extracts relevant features, calculates risk scores, and facilitates customers in purchase decisions, given a threshold on the risk score.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI-Based Sales Model Frameworks for Optimizing Resource Allocation and Scheduling</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In today's competitive market, efficient resource allocation and optimized scheduling are critical to driving sales growth. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models offer a transformative solution by leveraging data-driven insights to enhance decision-making processes. This paper explores frameworks for AI-based sales models, focusing on optimizing resource allocation and scheduling in sales operations. We examine various AI techniques, including machine learning, optimization algorithms, and predictive analytics, which enable businesses to allocate resources more effectively, automate task scheduling, and forecast sales trends with precision. By analyzing customer behavior, market conditions, and internal sales data, AI models can prioritize high-value customers, streamline sales workflows, and improve team productivity. The integration of ensemble methods such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, alongside advanced scheduling algorithms, allows for dynamic adjustments to sales strategies. This approach reduces inefficiencies, minimizes opportunity costs, and ensures that sales efforts are aligned with key business objectives. Additionally, we discuss the implementation of reinforcement learning and optimization algorithms to address real-time scheduling challenges. The proposed AI frameworks demonstrate improved sales performance by balancing resource utilization with customer demand patterns, ultimately driving revenue growth. Furthermore, we highlight key applications in industries such as retail, e-commerce, and B2B sales, providing actionable insights for sales leaders seeking to implement AI-driven strategies. Through case studies and performance metrics, this paper provides a comprehensive guide to deploying AI-based sales models to achieve optimal resource allocation and scheduling.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimized Learning for E-Commerce Sales Failure Prediction: An XGBoost Perspective</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Prediction of sales failures remains a major issue for e-commerce websites since this results in financial losses together with dissatisfied customers. This paper introduces an Optimized XGBoost Classifier integrated with Feature-Based Collaborative Filtering and Behavioral Analysis as an enhanced method to forecast e-commerce sales failures. Analysis uses three main components including site usage data and transaction records together with product specifications. The XGBoost settings receive fine-tuning in order to enhance our model performance. The performance analysis confirmed that our methodology reaches enhanced accuracy rates and works swifter than conventional models do. In addition, regional performance analysis showed that our model maintained high accuracy across nine user regions, and comparison with LightGBM and CatBoost confirmed XGBoost’s superior performance across most evaluation metrics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>WIPE: A Novel Web-Based Intelligent Packaging Evaluation via Machine Learning and Association Mining</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper introduces the Web-Based Intelligent Packaging Evaluation (WIPE) platform, a novel approach to assess the performance of product and packaging systems within the e-commerce distribution sector. Unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on laboratory evaluations under controlled conditions, WIPE addresses the unique challenges posed by e-commerce distribution, such as increased handling points and unforeseen hazards that standard physical tests may not capture. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and association rule mining, WIPE extracts insights about packaging defects directly from customer reviews on e-commerce platforms. Analyzing both images and text from these reviews establishes connections between frequently used words and the predicted damages, causes, and effects. This innovative approach was exemplified in two case studies involving laundry detergent liquid bottles and pods sold on the Amazon. The findings from these studies demonstrate WIPE’s capability to extract pertinent information from customer feedback and identify specific packaging defects and predict their potential causes. This integration of sentiment analysis and association rule mining into the packaging evaluation process marks a significant advancement in the field. The introduction of WIPE represents a transformative step in packaging evaluation, offering a more dynamic, real-world analysis that can significantly enhance product and packaging design, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction in the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Product Review Assistance Based on Feature Sentiment Analysis Using NLP</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In today's digital era, customers face challenges in making confident purchasing decisions due to the overwhelming volume of online product reviews. Simultaneously, manufacturers struggle to extract meaningful insights from this vast amount of feedback. There is a pressing need for a system that can efficiently analyze product reviews, offer valuable insights, and bridge the gap between customers and manufacturers, enabling informed choices and product enhancements in the real world. As a solution to this problem, in this work we propose a method which analyses the product reviews along with the extraction of product features and in result defining the overall sentiment towards the product by the consumers with respect to its good and bad features. The proposed methodology includes use of custom dataset with the help of web scrapping (flask), dependency parsing, sentiment prediction of reviews using BERT and matrix method to determine the feature sentiment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Benchmarking Explicit Rating Prediction Algorithms for Cosmetic Products</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommendation systems have become a staple feature for any e-commerce sites. The ability to predict whether a customer likes an unseen product forms the very foundation of a recommendation system. In this paper, we concern the issue of explicit rating prediction over cosmetic products. Given a dataset of cosmetic product ratings, we analyze the characteristics of the dataset and implement a wide range of algorithms, such as KNN and matrix factorization, to predict such ratings. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using MAE and RMSE measures, and discuss factors that may contribute to their performance results. Our experiments have shown that the SVD++ technique performs the best among all with an MAE of 0.7699 and an RMSE of 0.9696. We hope that our paper can shed new light on the selection of explicit rating prediction algorithms not only in the domain of beauty products, but also in wider scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks-Based Recommendation System for Banking Customers</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, machine learning approaches are replacing traditional methods in many industries. In parallel with these developments, marketing operations in banking started to be supported with machine learning based applications. In this study, a highly applicable product recommendation approach for banking customers was implemented using deep learning techniques. For this purpose, the dynamic recurrent neural network (DREAM) architecture, which was previously applied to e-commerce data, has been applied to banking customer data for recommendation system design. Comparative experiments with long short term memory and multilayer perceptron-based solutions have shown that the DREAM based recommendation approach has significant potential to be used in product proposal in the banking sector.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A New Maintenance Framework of WSN for Consumer and e-Commerce: A Convergence of AI, ML, and IoT</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this study is to integrate energy-efficient wireless sensor networks (WSNs) into consumer electronics manufacturing and e-commerce systems. The study focuses on two main objectives: developing predictive maintenance machine learning (ML) models for consumer electronics production, enhancing personalization and contextualization in e-commerce platforms using energy-efficient WSN architecture. By analyzing data from sensors embedded in manufacturing processes, the predictive maintenance models predict maintenance needs, which can optimize production efficiency, reduce unscheduled downtime, and improve resource allocation. This study also investigates the financial benefits of implementing predictive maintenance strategies, showing significant cost savings and improved resource allocation. The incorporation of WSN into e-commerce systems encompasses the entire consumer electronics lifecycle. By employing an energy-efficient WSN architecture, reliable data collection for predictive maintenance is achieved while minimizing environmental impact. Within the e-commerce domain, this integration enhances customer experiences by ensuring products are delivered in optimal condition, thereby fostering customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, the architecture facilitates personalization and contextualization, providing consumers with customized recommendations based on their preferences and real-time contextual information.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Software cost estimation still presents a real challenge to software development firms and practitioners. One of the crucial activities in project management is software cost estimation. The accuracy of the estimated cost has a critical impact on the project’s success or failure. Overestimation and underestimation are serious challenges to project managers, especially in today’s competitive marketplace. Inaccurate estimation may lead to over budget, missing deadlines, business loss, and even project failure. The precise cost estimation will enable the project manager to forecast and allocate the necessary resources to deliver a successful product. Many researchers have published research papers in this area. In this paper, the study’s goal is to outline the recent machine learning approaches to software cost estimation. The study will address the problems with conventional cost estimation models and provide a comprehensive review of the researches regarding software cost estimation with machine learning. The current study will discuss the intelligence models for software cost estimation and highlight the models that excel in this area.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>How to Train an All-Purpose Robot: DeepMind is Tackling one of the Hardest Problems for AI</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Artificial intelligence has reached deep into our lives, though you might be hard pressed to point to obvious examples of it. Among countless other behind-the-scenes chores, neural networks power our virtual assistants, make online shopping recommendations, recognize people in our snapshots, scrutinize our banking transactions for evidence of fraud, transcribe our voice messages, and weed out hateful social-media postings. What these applications have in common is that they involve learning and operating in a constrained, predictable environment. • But embedding AI more firmly into our endeavors and enterprises poses a great challenge. To get to the next level, researchers are trying to fuse AI and robotics to create an intelligence that can make decisions and control a physical body in the messy, unpredictable, and unforgiving real world. It's a potentially revolutionary objective that has caught the attention of some of the most powerful tech-research organizations on the planet. “I'd say that robotics as a field is probably 10 years behind where computer vision is,” says Raia Hadsell, head of robotics at DeepMind, Google's London-based AI partner. (Both companies are subsidiaries of Alphabet.) • Even for Google, the challenges are daunting. Some are hard but straightforward: For most robotic applications, it's difficult to gather the huge data sets that have driven progress in other areas of AI. But some problems are more profound, and relate to long-standing conundrums in AI. Problems like, how do you learn a new task without forgetting the old one? And how do you create an AI that can apply the skills it learns for a new task to the tasks it has mastered before?</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Conversion Prediction from Clickstream: Modeling Market Prediction and Customer Predictability</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As 98 percent of shoppers do not make a purchase on the first visit, we study the problem of predicting whether they would come back for a purchase later (i.e., conversion prediction). This problem is important for strategizing “retargeting”, for example, by sending coupons for customers who are likely to convert. For this goal, we study the following two problems, prediction of market and predictability of customer. First, prediction of market aims at identifying a conversion rate for a given product and its customer behavior modeling, which is an important analytics metric for retargeting process. Compared to existing approaches using either of customer or product-level conversion pattern, we propose a joint modeling of both patterns based on the well-studied buying decision process. Second, we can observe customer-specific behaviors after showing retargeting ads, to predict whether this specific customer follows the market model (high predictability) or not (low predictability). For the former, we apply the market model, and for the latter, we propose a new customer-specific prediction based on dynamic ad behavior features. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we perform extensive experiments on the simulated dataset generated based on a set of real-world web logs and retargeting campaign logs. The evaluation results show that conversion predictions and predictability by our approach are consistently more accurate and robust than those by existing baselines in dynamic market environment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Leveraging Ensemble Learning for Dry Beans Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>For dietary and commercial purposes, dry beans are significant. Dry beans offer many advantages, such as energy and protein. It is crucial to the fight against malnutrition and ensuring food security. The most crucial element in the manufacturing of dry beans is the condition of the seed. As the quality of the seed is so important, seed verification is crucial for dry bean farmers and marketplaces. Choosing high-quality seeds is essential to achieving optimal yield. This research uses a variety of machine-learning techniques to classify different varieties of dry beans. For this research work, a dataset from the UCI machine learning repository is used. The outcomes of model evaluation have been compared, and various classifiers have been trained. In the process, the k-fold cross-validation technique is applied with k = 10 as a parameter. This research aims to differentiate between the seven different types of dry beans by using classification algorithms. An accuracy of 82.01%, 93.46%, 94.67%, and 94.64% has been achieved with the k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, naïve Bayes, and random forest classifiers respectively. Also, the voting ensemble classifier has an accuracy of 95.46%. After the experiments, it was observed that the voting ensemble classifier has the highest accuracy. Future research can examine the performance of new algorithms for better results. Additionally, the dataset can be increased to improve the model's accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing E-Commerce Product Recommendations Using LLMs and Transformer-Based Deep Learning Architectures</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The integration of large language models with deep learning architectures brought an evolutionary revolution in the context of product recommendation systems because of several limitations of traditional methods, such as collaborative and content-based filtering. In this paper, a novel framework for product recommendation is proposed by integrating large language models jointly with deep learning. The contribution of large language models is that it adds semantic understanding capability to the predictive power provided through neural networks. Domain ontologies will be used in this hybrid model to enhance the accuracy and personalization of recommendations, considering complex user preferences and product attributes in e-commerce platforms. It takes a state-of-the-art pre-trained LLM, such as Llama-3, as input and generates personalized embeddings of users based on history, item descriptions, and contextual information. In this work, the Transformer architecture has been used in re-fining and ranking the products for relevance using attention mechanisms that select the most important features in each recommendation task. Besides, knowledge distillation will be used to conduct the small and efficient student model training process. The distilled model receives soft predictions that involve the teacher LLM, which greatly reduces computational overhead but preserves high recommendation accuracy. Eventually, the framework will be evaluated on a real-world e-commerce dataset to explore how it increases the click-through rate, purchase rate, and user's engagement compared to the traditional systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI-Powered Customer Purchase Prediction based on Shopping History and Browsing Patterns</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents the use of machine learning (ML) in online buying behavior prediction from user interactions and browsing history with the help of Random Forest algorithm. A large dataset was utilized, and sophisticated preprocessing methods like feature scaling, categorical encoding, and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) were employed to handle class imbalance and data complexity. The Random Forest model performed superbly with an accuracy of 96.3% and an AUC value of 0.97; it can efficiently classify the purchased and nonpurchase users. Page Values, Product Related Duration, and Bounce Rates are significant predictors of purchase. Actionable insights emerge for targeting strategies in optimizing e-commerce through customer engagement. The paper further delves into ethical considerations about using predictive modeling, such as bias mitigation and compliance to data privacy requirements. With the use of data-driven insights, companies operating in retail, finance, and healthcare can thus improve decision-making, user experiences, and strategic growth. Future research will investigate more alternative models for ML that could include deep learning techniques to further optimize predictive accuracy and scalability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Food Review Analysis and Sentiment Prediction using Machine Learning Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this era of the digital world, text, messages, comments, numbers and videos have become an essential source of information. The trend of people trading through e-commerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart is proliferating. It’s necessary to have a model or tool that helps retrieve helpful information from the customers’ online reviews quickly that can also help product manufacturers have a better idea of their product. This paper targets the food industry, and a model is proposed that analyzes the customer reviews based on NLP techniques- TF-IDF Vectorizer and Count Vectorizer. Based on these analyses, customer sentiments are predicted using different machine learning classification algorithms like Logistic regression, Dummy classifier and Random forest classifier.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Joint Learning Recommendation Model for E-Commerce Platforms Integrating Long-Term and Short-Term Interests</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommendation systems greatly improve user experience with personalized suggestions. Much research utilizes deep learning to extract user interest features, yet often neglects their real-time and dynamic aspects. This paper proposes a joint learning-based recommendation model (JLS-Rec) for e-commerce platforms, integrating both short-term and long-term user interests. First, for users’ long-term interests, the paper suggests mining more detailed interests from user behavior sequences. This method decouples the behavior sequence in horizontal and vertical directions using a Convolutional Neural Network to learn the user's long-term interests. Second, for users’ short-term interests, the JLS-Rec method learns feature transformations on users’ recent behavior sequences by stacking multiple self-attention mechanisms, resulting in dynamic representations of the user's short-term interests at the current stage. Finally, based on the principle of prioritizing short-term memory without neglecting long-term interests, the paper proposes a joint learning framework with dual embeddings to balance the two characteristics of user long-term and short-term interests. This framework generates accurate recommendation results while utilizing these two interest features to predict user feedback on products. The experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively mines the long-term and short-term interest information of users in the features, thereby improving the recommendation accuracy of e-commerce platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Macroeconomic Event Base Expert Advisor for Forex Trades: Through Algo Trading</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>An implicit foreign exchange trading decision is generally at the mercy of effective forex forecasting. Forex trade has been scrutinized using two sequestered approaches, technical and fundamental analysis. The fundamental data of the economy, correspondingly have a decisive influence on the forex. The idea of seeing the macroeconomic announcements turns progressively challenging due to the direction of the gigantic and variant figure of prices' determining factor and the rapid fluctuations in market dynamics. The main aim of this study is to develop a macroeconomic event base expert advisor to identify the patterns and provide a signal and automate trades based fundamental analysis to forex day traders. Moreover, the paper emphasizes the association between forex high-frequency dynamic forces and macroeconomic announcements that can be determined as events. The sensitive nature of the macroeconomic factors in the forex market must be considered in any system that efforts to deliver users with reasonable and effective insights into the market. The expected implication is to provide a novel methodology for the interested parties and provide a more accurate algo trading system for Forex Day traders. This expert advisor helps to address the gaps in fundamental analysis-based studies and helps to make successful and proper trading decisions as well. This study applies the Machine learning methodologies like linear regression, support vector machine to Random Forest optimizes indicators parameters in order to react straightway to slight variation in the marketplace status by producing swap signals driven fundamental analyses. Further main algorithm develops using mathematical modeling and Backpropagation Weight Decay Neural Network.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Secure Automated Inventory Management system using Abstracted System Design Microservice Architecture</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Managing inventory has forever been a difficult problem for e-commerce sellers. Even today manual labor is used for the major part of the job. Without much automation in this industry growth has been stagnant because of the same reason.The proposed system works on a microservice-based architecture that enables automated inventory management with the help of a social-media messaging bot in an abstract manner. The bot comprises an integrated hybrid recommender system at the customer’s end for better recommendations based on image and textual data. The entire system is deployed on the cloud following a serverless architecture for resilient service. The proposed solution plays a key role in taking research forward in the direction of micro-service-based system design involving real-world data. The results of the experiment prove to be beneficial for customers and retailers since they are now connected using the micro-service.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Impacts of Fake Reviews on Dietary Supplements and Healthcare Products in Social Media</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In today’s digital landscape, the prevalence of misinformation is a pressing concern, particularly on social media platforms where approximately 42.8 % of shared content is identified as inaccurate and fake, as highlighted by a 2019 study from Loughborough University’s Online Civic Culture Centre. This phenomenon extends beyond mere inconvenience, with false information on political issues and product reviews posing significant threats to societal trust, business integrity, and political discourse. Furthermore, “The State of Fake Reviews - Statistics and Trends” by InvespCRO (2023) underscores a concerning trend: the steady rise in fake reviews from 2019 to 2023, indicative of a persistent challenge in maintaining online authenticity. This article delves into the intriguing world of online reviews, focusing specifically on the impact of falsified reviews within the realm of supplements and health products. With the power to sway consumer opinions and shape company reputations, false reviews wield considerable influence, often distorting market perceptions and consumer choices. By immersing ourselves in a hypothetical scenario where a product garners an alluring yet deceitful review, we unravel the ripple effects across various sectors, illuminating the far-reaching consequences of deceptive practices.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Leveraging Multimodal Shapley Values to Address Multimodal Collapse and Improve Fine-Grained E-Commerce Product Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Multimodal models can experience multimodal collapse, leading to sub-optimal performance on tasks like fine-grained e-commerce product classification. To address this, we introduce an approach that leverages multimodal Shapley values (MM-SHAP) to quantify the individual contributions of each modality to the model's predictions. By employing weighted stacked ensembles of unimodal and multimodal models, with weights derived from these Shapley values (MM-SHAP), we enhance the overall performance and mitigate the effects of multimodal collapse. Using this approach we improve previous results(f1-score) from 0.67 to 0.79.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Robust Fake Review Detection Using Uncertainty-Aware LSTM and BERT</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In a web-based world driven by e-commerce, customers are quick to turn to online shopping services. However, the products available for purchase cannot be personally inspected so buyers turn to online product reviews. Consumers trust these reviews and are likely to spend more at stores with good evaluations. Sellers are well aware of this phenomenon and are not averse to using unethical methods to boost the reputation of their own products, or demerit the products of their rivals. In other words, fake reviews are quite rampant and are responsible for heavily affecting consumer purchasing decisions and business profits. In response, many fake review detection models have been extensively explored in the last decade. However, there is still a lack of robustness in these approaches. Our research addresses this gap in the field of fake review detection. We deploy the BERT and LSTM models coupled with the Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) technique, on the Yelp Labelled Dataset comprising 10,000 hotel reviews from North America. MCD provides a representation of uncertainty by randomly dropping neurons in multiple predictions of the network. This gives us an approximation of the uncertainty. Since, fake review detection is a risky task we employ MCD to make our system robust and reliable. Our study yields an accuracy of 91.75% using the MCD-embedded BERT model. It outperforms the LSTM model overall.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Fuzzy Logic and Machine Learning Hybrid Model for Influencing Consumer Purchasing Behavior in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rise of the Internet, online shopping has become an integral aspect of contemporary living, greatly impacting consumer behaviour in e-commerce. In e-commerce, good emotions and easy navigation play significant roles in driving consumer actions, in contrast to traditional retail settings were establishing human rapport influences purchasing decisions. The suggested approach employs state-of-the-art data preparation methods, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to improve data quality, in order to comprehend and foretell these behaviours. First, the FKNN technique is used for regression modelling after using SA for effective feature selection. In an effort to enhance prediction accuracy, this study explores various FKNN versions based on Minkowski, Manhattan, and Euclidean distances. By obtaining the best prediction accuracy, the lowest average error, and an overall accuracy of 95.36%, the results show that the MdFKNN far surpasses previous methods. The MdFKNN model shows promise in solving regression issues in e-commerce analytics, as shown by these results. Ultimately, the study highlights how important intelligent modelling techniques are for better understanding consumer purchase behaviour in e-commerce environments and making predictions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Model of E-commerce Recommender System using Enhancement Document Context Based on Attention and User Information Based on Auto Encoder and Latent Factor</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender system is essential tool in e-commerce application. Recommender system responsible to produce relevant information to customer. The successful adoption of recommender system influence of e-commerce company revenue. Collaborative filtering is the most successful of recommender system algorithm that adopted in many large e-commerce company. Collaborative filtering relies on rating matrix to produce product index recommendation. However, number of rating matrix very sparse due to majority customer are lazy to rate the product. In this research, we implemented product document information enhancement using attention mechanism that combined with stack denoising auto encoder (SDAE) to extract user information and latent factor based on probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). According to our experiment report, our model success to improve the performance over previous work more than 18% in average over traditional PMF in ML.M and ML.10M.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deciphering Key Features in Online Buying Session Prediction Using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper explores the key factors influencing online buying session prediction using nomogram analysis with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models. We analyzed a dataset containing various attributes of online shoppers. Our results underscore that the Logistic Regression has superior capability for both True and False targets in terms of accuracy (0.883) and AUC (0.897). While Naïve Bayes performs better for the True target with an F1Score of 0.555, Logistic Regression demonstrates superior performance for the False target with an F1 Score of 0.934. Nomogram analysis revealed that for Naive Bayes, page values, exit rates, and bounce rates are the most significant factors, while for Logistic Regression, page values and product-related features (ProductRelated and ProductRelated_Duration) are the most significant. Visualizing these key factors through nomograms helps interpret their relative importance to support the accuracy and interpretability of machine learning predictions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Deep Learning Model for Classification of EEG Signals for Neuromarketing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Advertising campaigns for marketing and advertisement of different consumer items is a well-known strategy to boost sales and public awareness. It can lead towards greater profit margins for the factories or companies. Reproduction of products typically depends on numerous factors, such as market usage, reviewer comments, ratings, etc. In neuromarketing a person is examined with the help of EEG signals generated in his/her brain so that his emotions can be recognized for making certain decisions. Therefore, research in this area is in high demand but has not yet achieved an adequate standard. We provide a predictive modelling framework to interpret consumer preferences for e-commerce goods by analyzing EEG data. In this research study, volunteers of varying ages and genders were asked to visually feel the effect of different packaging of products and the corresponding EEG signals generated inside their brains were monitored. Several experiments by varying approaches were performed on the dataset that contain the EEG signals of consumers. Two machine learning and a deep learning classifier were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the model. After conducting different experiments, it was observed that the proposed approach performs superior, and the framework can be leveraged to create a more effective business model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Two-phase feature extraction with chi square-based feature selection approach for the classification of online product reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As Internet technology progresses, users are increasingly opting for online shopping. Users can now not only purchase items but also offer feedback on their satisfaction with them. In terms of enhancing product quality, these reviews are incredibly valuable to both the user and the vendor. It becomes challenging to manually process a large amount of review data that is increasing in volume, subjectivity, and heterogeneity. To address this issue, machine learning (ML) technologies have been used in real-world applications, although there are still many hurdles. In order to achieve a more accurate result, this research study has used a mix of many fundamental machine learning techniques. Two-phase feature Extraction is used with chi square-based feature selection (FS) to reduce the dimension of the data. Three Ensamble classifiers were utilised, which merged several basic classifiers to choose the best outcome. The suggested model is tested using a dataset of 74000 product reviews from two well-known e-commerce sites, Flipkart and Amazon. And the model produces the most accurate results, with a 98% accuracy rate.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting Customer Class using Customer Lifetime Value with Random Forest Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As there are a lot of booming online retailers in e-commerce industry in the Internet age, the need of maintaining competitive advantages has become to pay attention to customer relationship management (CRM). To build a successful CRM strategy, it is needed to know individual customer class which can be calculated from Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): the monetary value of customers purchased from the business during their lifetime. CLV modelling allows us to identify customer's predicted business value. It provides the retailers for effectively allocating the resource in their business. This predictive model has been taken on the global Super Store Retail dataset with almost ten thousand transactions. Our model will predict the customers' class of the next year based on their CLV that will help the online retailer to decide which customer should be invested to get long term CRM. Random Forest (RF) algorithm is utilized to train our model and Random Search tuning is conducted to get the best predictive accuracy. The experimental analysis is performed to compare with AdaBoost algorithm on the same dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Apriori Algorithm based Association Rule Mining to Enhance Small-Scale Retailer Sales</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This research aims to assist small online gift store retailers who have not yet adopted a recommender system by leveraging association rules to offer personalized product recommendations to their customers. Using the Apriori algorithm and association rule mining techniques in Python, a dataset of UK online gift store retailer sales transactions was analyzed to identify frequent itemsets and association rules. The main objective of this research is to enable retailers to better manage their inventory and boost sales by offering products that customers are likely to purchase based on their previous buying behaviour. The result presents the top 10 frequent itemsets and their support values, along with a list of association rules. The result indicates that candlelight holders, bags, and tableware items are frequently purchased together. This research provides valuable insights for small online gift store retailers to enhance their sales performance and customer satisfaction by leveraging association rules to offer personalized product recommendations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Binary Classification of Pneumonia Disease Using SVM-GAN Augmentation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Pneumonia is a respiratory disease that causes inflammation of the lungs due to the accumulation of fluid in the air sacs of the alveoli. This disease can affect one or both lungs. According to a study by the World Health Organization, all children, newborns and people over the age of 65 suffer from this disease. Deep learning algorithms reduce the workload of medical professionals by automating the necessary procedures, since physical examinations by radiologists do not always provide accurate results in the process of disease detection and are also somewhat time-consuming. This article discusses the classifications of pneumonia, and non-pneumonia. The most frequent diagnostic method for these disorders is chest X-rays, which are utilized as scanned pictures. The SVM and GAN technique was used to classify the disease. The photos that were gathered were acquired from online retailers, and the present data volume was raised using the GAN algorithm, which helped to train and test the model more successfully in the future using SVM. Combined, a better accuracy of 98.5% than that of previous methods was attained. As a result, the suggested approach makes it possible to identify pneumonia more rapidly and to classify the condition even from a limited quantity of data. It can be a useful tool for radiologists and other medical professionals working in this area.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Novel Customer Review Analysis System Based on Balanced Deep Review and Rating Differences in User Preference</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid growth of mobile applications and online e-commerce websites has made it easy to gather information to create an enormous quantity of training data to aid consumers in making decisions about what to purchase. On online shopping sites, a helpful review analysis of user reviews can significantly increase users’ loyalty. People may significantly influence the market value of goods and customer confidence in e-commerce decisions by using ratings, and reviews. One major issue with users’ rating prediction models is that they ignore variations across users that fall inside the user’s preferences or reviews. In this paper, we develop a new balanced helpful recommendation model with quantifying users’ tendencies (BHRQUT)-based on personalized reviews and ratings to predict helpful reviews and improve recommendation accuracy by creating an auxiliary feature that is computed based on actual ratings and predicted ratings. Text sequence processing was acquired by experimental research on the influence of word vector embedding dimension and word frequency of review text, utilizing (NLP). These features were transformed into vectors based on the embedding layer to the balanced (CNN-BiLSTM) model. Experimental evaluations are performed on four review datasets from the 5-score Amazon domain and our model can significantly enhance the accuracy of helpful review text analysis by 97 percent. According to the experimental results when we compared with other deep recommendation approaches concerning multiple metrics and drew from the different experiments, the presented model can enhance the analyzability of user feedback by enhancing decision-making confidence without reducing accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Object Detection of Furniture and Home Goods Using Advanced Computer Vision</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Object Detection Technology has been a subject to much research and development due to increasing use of images and videos as data sources and their huge number of applications. Traditional models for object detection had limitations in training and did not use transfer learning for their benefit. With the evolution of deep learning and Neural networks, newer and powerful tools have made way to achieve Object Detection in real-time, with the added advantage of transfer learning and detection of multiple instances of different classes of interest in the given image context. The proposed system is an Object Detection model based on the Single Shot Detector (SSD) algorithm trained with MobileNetV2 feature extraction that can be utilized and integrated in e-commerce, hospitality industry, security and surveillance, real estate, self-driving cars and floor inventory management.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>On The Understanding of Customer Purchase Behavior: A Case Study on the Computer Systems E-Commerce Website</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The tremendous growth of the E-commerce industry over the last decade drew attention to the importance of understanding customers' behaviors and modeling user-system interactions to maximize customers' satisfaction by providing them the best user experience and gaining new customers to the e-commerce website. Within the scope of this study, software architecture _that can help us understand customers' purchase behaviors and then make a binary prediction based on their interactions with the system to determine whether a computer configuration will be bought_ is proposed and explained thor-oughly. For this purpose, machine learning algorithms are utilized to correctly model complex user-system interactions. A prototype of the proposed software architecture is developed using the latest technologies, and experimental studies are performed on top of this prototype in order to understand how successful our software architecture is. The conducted experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed software architecture in real-world data, with 83% and 88% scores for the accuracy and F1-score metrics, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Coupon Personalization: Leveraging Click Data with Deep Learning for Behavioral Insights</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes a deep learning (DL) framework that leverages customer multidimensional click sequence data on e-commerce platforms to predict purchase probabilities and optimize personalized coupon issuance policy. Our study aims to bridge the gap in the existing literature that focuses only on page view and purchase data, thus overlooking the nuanced customer behaviors captured through actions such as adding products to carts and marking them as favorites. We construct a customer-product bipartite graph in the framework and apply heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques to accommodate individual differences between customers and products. We employ the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to unravel the latent psychological processes underlying customer purchasing decisions. The two matrices in HMM serve as an enhanced embedding to provide more accurate predictions (about 10% enhancement) with higher interpretability. Lastly, we employ the Bellman equation to formulate an optimal coupon issuance policy. We use click data of cosmetics and snacks on a particular e-commerce platform to demonstrate the interpretability of our model. Our findings indicate that HMM’s hidden transition matrix effectively reflects customer loyalty towards cosmetics and extensive browsing patterns in the snacks category. Furthermore, we observe that the revenue increase from each customer after coupon personalization is proportionate with the probabilities of different clicking actions implied by the HMM.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Comprehensive Sentiment Analysis for Mining Consumer Opinion in Online Product Rating</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study conducts a comprehensive analysis contrasting two distinct sentiment analysis models: VADER and Roberta, a sophisticated pre-trained deep learning model integrated via the Transformers library pipeline. Emphasizing their performance in predicting sentiment from product ratings and reviews, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of their respective methodologies. Initially, an extensive review of VADER's rule-based approach and Roberta's advanced pre-trained architecture is presented, highlighting unique strengths and limitations inherent in each model. Subsequently, both models undergo rigorous training and evaluation using a rich dataset of product ratings and reviews, consisting of 500 readings carefully selected from the larger dataset of 568,454 readings. Rigorous assessment metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, are employed to gauge their proficiency in sentiment classification. The study's outcomes shed light on the applicability and efficiency of NLTK-anchored VADER and Roberta within the e-commerce sphere, contributing valuable insights into leveraging distinct models for extracting actionable customer insights. Specifically, VADER achieved an accuracy of 82%, precision of 78%, and recall of 85%, while Roberta demonstrated higher performance with an accuracy of 88%, precision of 85%, and recall of 90%. By exploring product rating sentiment analysis, this research facilitates informed, data-driven decisions for businesses, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and refining product development strategies for sustainable growth. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging advanced deep learning techniques for robust sentiment analysis in modern e-commerce ecosystems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Small Sample Classification Based on Prompt Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of the information age and the gradual popularization of online shopping, a large amount of transaction information is generated during the transaction process of goods, and the transaction data has enormous analytical value. For the problem of e-commerce text classification, most of the current mainstream text classification methods are applicable to large-scale data samples. For the classification model in the low resource scenario, there will be overfitting problems on small samples, while in the e-commerce platform transaction process, there will be a situation where the amount of large-scale data cannot be reached. In order to fully extract the Semantic information of short text e-commerce data, a small sample e-commerce classification research based on prompt learning was proposed. Firstly, based on the pre trained language model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) for feature vector representation, an e-commerce text prompt template is designed based on the idea of prompt learning. The text classification task is transformed into a cloze filling task, and the predicted classification label is obtained through model training. The editing distance is calculated to obtain the final label. Comparative experiments were conducted on different sample sizes, datasets, and models, and the experimental results showed that the proposed method had better results, verifying the effectiveness of the model and having certain practical value for commodity analysis on e-commerce platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Optimized Decision Tree Model for Agricultural Product Placement Using Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Big data technologies have gradually penetrated various industries, leading to the development of transparency in agricultural market data information. At the same time, consumer behavior has become increasingly complex, and previous extensive management methods are no longer effective in increasing sales. This has led to the urgent need for marketplaces to adjust their management strategies to effectively increase sales and seize more market share. This paper proposes a method to address this issue: by using a decision tree model for classification and prediction and employing a cross-selection of decision tree algorithm and clustering algorithm to predict agricultural product data in the market area. The results show that the model is relatively accurate and can help agricultural markets develop product sales plans. The model's accuracy in predicting market conditions is high, and it has guiding value for the placement of agricultural products in various markets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Developing and Evaluating Machine Learning Models in Recommendation Systems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the current digital transformation era and e-commerce, recommendation systems (RS) have become vital in optimizing profits and finding and reaching potential customers. Large companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc.) possess huge amounts of data about customers and goods and it is important to exploit information to create customer suggestion systems. Suitable products will improve customer experience, save advertising costs, and sell more products. Therefore, it will make huge profits from marketing and e-commerce. This paper aims to build and optimize popular models for the problem of RS on the MovieLens dataset. Therefore, we test and compare the capabilities predictions of these types of models. In addition, this project uses PySpark technology to increase the amount of data aiming for execution on large datasets in practice to evaluate how the amount of data affects the ability to suggest. We also present the models and the construction installation steps environment and optimize their parameters. We assess each algorithm on the Movielens 100k and 1M. The results show that the model has MAE as 81.21% and 87.47% on two datasets Movielens 100k and 20M.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Forecasting Online Shoppers Purchase Intentions with Cat Boost Classifier</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online shopping refers to the process of purchasing goods or services over the internet from e-commerce websites or online marketplaces allowing consumers to browse, select, and buy products without physically visiting a store.Users do not necessarily visit e-commerce sites with a buy purpose, but rather to browse and engage with things before leaving without generating cash for the firm. This is the challenge that every e-commerce faces. To solve this challenge it is necessary to predict the purchasing intentions of online shoppers for focusing on interested customers and generating income in the future.After knowing customer intention(buy or not buy) it is easy to generate individualized product recommendations, offer discounts, and perform numerous interventions to improve the overall customer experience.Predicting customer purchase behavior ahead of time is difficult. In this study,a proposed system is build to predict the online shoppers intention (buy or not buy) by analyzing different classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Ada Boosting, LightGBM, Cat Boost. The experiments were performed on online shoppers intention dataset. Experimental results show that Cat Boost classifier with hyperparameter tuning can predict with highest accuracy, which is 98.73%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Graph Library: Overview, Updates, and Future Developments [GrAPL 2020 Keynote Speaker]</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Learning from graph and relational data plays a major role in many applications including social network analysis, marketing, ecommerce, information retrieval, knowledge modeling, medical and biological sciences, engineering, and others. In the last few years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising new supervised learning framework capable of bringing the power of deep representation learning to graph and relational data. This ever-growing body of research has shown that GNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance for problems such as link prediction, fraud detection, target-ligand binding activity prediction, knowledge-graph completion, and product recommendations. Deep Graph Library (DGL) is an open source development framework for writing and training GNN-based models. It is designed to simplify the development of such models by using graphbased abstractions while at the same time achieving high computational efficiency and scalability by relying on optimized sparse matrix operations and existing highly optimized standard deep learning frameworks (e.g., MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow). This talk provides an overview of DGL, describes some recent developments related to high-performance multi-GPU, multi-core, and distributed training, and describes our future development roadmap.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Modeling approaches for Silent Attrition prediction in Payment networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting customer attrition (churn) is a well known problem in industries that provide services, like financial institutions, telecommunications, e-commerce, and retail. There are two kinds of attrition - active and passive (silent). Active attrition is usually associated with subscription-based business models, commonly seen in telecommunications and internet industries like Netflix. In industries like finance, retail, and ecommerce, we see the other kind of attrition - silent attrition where customers stop doing business without formal notice. This makes the silent attrition prediction problem even more challenging because it is difficult to differentiate between attrited and inactive customers. We focus our work on predicting silent attrition which is still under-explored in the payment card industry (i.e. Mastercard, Visa). The contribution of our work is threefold. First, we present a data-driven approach to define silent attrition as customer inactivity. Second, we discussed multiple procedures to generate synthetic data thereby preserving customers’ privacy. At last, we presented a comprehensive view of various machine learning (ML) pathways in which this churn prediction problem can be framed and solved; each requiring a specific feature engineering. We presented experimental results corresponding to each pathway to comparative analysis. We believe that this work to be beneficial to the researchers and ML practitioners who often have to deal with sensitive financial data but have limited permission to use it. In this direction, we demonstrated the use of synthetic data generation to reduce the risk of data leakage and other privacy concerns relating to ML models development.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Virtual Matching System with Virtual Try-On (VTON) for Enhanced Online Shopping Experience</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, the rapid growth of e-commerce has transformed consumer shopping behavior, especially in the fashion industry. One of the major challenges remains the inability to try on clothing before purchase, often leading to dissatisfaction with size, fit, and style. To address this, the proposed Virtual Try-On (VTON) system that leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques, including pose estimation, human parsing, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to deliver realistic clothing simulations. The system allows users to upload an image and visualize how garments would appear on their bodies in real time. Trained on the IGPair dataset, the proposed system achieved 92% accuracy in clothing alignment, a visual quality score of 4.7/5.0, and a processing time of just 4.2 seconds per image. These results demonstrate that the system significantly enhances user confidence, reduces product returns, and provides a more personalized and immersive online shopping experience.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Exploring Consumer Purchase Psychology in E-Commerce Using BiLSTM and Dense Neural Network Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Modern e-commerce platforms provide a large quantity of products, but the sheer volume of information can be daunting to users. The ability for product suggestion algorithms to cater to specific users' tastes greatly improves their overall experience. Since consumer spending habits reflect fundamental psychological processes, tailored ideas boost involvement and contentment. Using a proprietary recommendation system, this study examines consumer behaviour on local e-commerce sites that facilitate group purchase. Applying NLP to analyse data provided by users enhances automation and information retrieval. In order to uncover important details, natural language processing looks at social structures. We reduce dimensionality using a principal component analysis method that employs PEVD. To predict how much money consumers will spend, we use Dense-BiLSTM. When it came to forecasting customers' buying habits, the Dense-BiLSTM model hit a validation accuracy of 95.58%. Natural language processing and dimensionality reduction improve the accuracy and efficiency of recommendations. The results show that customised recommendations are much improved with the use of strong machine learning algorithms and NLP analysis. By reducing data overload, the suggested method improves the efficiency and customisation of online shopping. Future studies might refine the model to account for customers' changing behaviour in real time.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Role of Machine Learning Analysis and Metrics in Retailing Industry by using Progressive Analysis Pattern Technique</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Analyzing customer purchasing data has been a challenging task for data analyzers. Even though lots of methods are introduced in this kind of research but still many barriers are there to finding the optimal pattern. Consider customer buying data is used to examine the types of parameters which is influence the customer. In this proposed work, Progressive Analysis Pattern Technique (PAPT) to predict future customer buying patterns in online shopping. We incorporated dynamic data handling prior to the proposed methodology. It will give ample purpose for the organization's perspective because the proposed work primarily focused on customer features related to the number of product quantities and product price variations of the previous purchase. Marketing strategies are most effective if they are focused to the exact client requirements. A Significant mission in campaign planning is deciding which customer to target. This research paper focusses on empirical targeting models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting User Purchases From Clickstream Data: A Comparative Analysis of Clickstream Data Representations and Machine Learning Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting purchase events from e-commerce clickstream data is a critical challenge with significant implications for optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer experience. This study addresses this challenge by systematically evaluating and comparing multiple data representations – aggregated session attributes, recent user actions, and hybrid combinations – which bridges gaps in the existing literature and demonstrates the superiority of hybrid approaches. Unlike prior research, which typically focuses on single representations, our approach combines aggregated session-level summaries with granular, sequential user actions to capture both long-term and short-term behavioral patterns. Through comprehensive experimentation, we compared multiple machine learning models, including LightGBM, decision trees, gradient boosting, SVC, and logistic regression, using real-world e-commerce clickstream data. Notably, the hybrid representation with LightGBM achieved superior predictive performance, significantly outperforming alternative methods. Feature importance analysis revealed key factors influencing purchase likelihood, such as time since the last event, session duration, and product interactions. This study provides actionable insights into real-time marketing interventions by demonstrating the practical utility of hybrid data representations and efficient tree-based models. Our findings offer a scalable and interpretable framework for e-commerce platforms to enhance purchase predictions and optimize marketing strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>IoT-Enabled E-Commerce Platform Integrating Blockchain and AI for Secure, Transparent, and Sustainable Organic Trade</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The growing demand for organic products requires reliable mechanisms for authenticity verification and supply chain transparency, as conventional e-commerce platforms face challenges like fraudulent labeling, misrepresentation, and inefficiencies. This study introduces an IoT-driven e-commerce platform that integrates smart sensors, blockchain authentication, and AI-driven cloud analytics to enhance traceability and consumer trust. IoT sensors deployed in farms, storage, and transportation units monitor temperature, humidity, and pesticide levels in real time to ensure compliance with organic standards. Blockchain technology establishes an immutable certification ledger, preventing fraud and securing transaction integrity. Experimental results indicate 40% reduction in verification latency, 92% fraud detection accuracy, and 88% improvement in supply chain scalability, outperforming traditional certification methods. AI-based analytics optimize demand forecasting with 87% accuracy, while blockchain transaction success rates range from 96% to 99%, ensuring secure authentication. Comparative analysis shows a 15% improvement in verification speed and a 17% reduction in operational costs due to automated compliance validation and real-time monitoring. User engagement analysis reveals a 78% interaction rate with blockchain-backed certification records, strengthening consumer confidence in organic authenticity. Despite scalability and computational challenges, this IoT-blockchain framework enhances trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance, making it a secure and sustainable solution for organic trade.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predictive Analytics for Customer Retention: A CatBoost Model for Churn Detection</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Competitive marketplaces make customer retention a priority since businesses spend more on acquiring new customers than on keeping current ones. The research uses CatBoost as its algorithm because it represents a gradientboosting model that excels at processing categorical data to improve churn prediction accuracy. An analysis of the 440,834entry customer churn dataset used our team to complete thorough preprocessing alongside feature engineering and model training activities. The CatBoost model demonstrated superior performance when compared to logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost because it achieved higher accuracy levels and lower computational resources and overfitting. The examine of metrics shows outstanding success where the training accuracy matched validation accuracy at 99.89 % and 99.88 % respectively and precision scored 100 % and the F1-score achieved 99.90 %. CatBoost's powerful categorical feature abilities together with its automated hyperparameter execution maintained a validation loss at a minimal 0.71 %. This paper demonstrates why CatBoost functions well with real-life customer retention problems since it delivers tangible solutions that help companies prevent customer attrition. The research contributes to academic analysis of machine learning models along with real-world CRM strategies due to optimized predictive processes and superior accuracy achievement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Learning to Recommend With Multiple Cascading Behaviors</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Most existing recommender systems leverage user behavior data of one type only, such as the purchase behavior in E-commerce that is directly related to the business Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of conversion rate. Besides the key behavioral data, we argue that other forms of user behaviors also provide valuable signal, such as views, clicks, adding a product to shopping carts and so on. They should be taken into account properly to provide quality recommendation for users. In this work, we contribute a new solution named short for Neural Multi-Task Recommendation (NMTR) for learning recommender systems from user multi-behavior data. We develop a neural network model to capture the complicated and multi-type interactions between users and items. In particular, our model accounts for the cascading relationship among different types of behaviors (e.g., a user must click on a product before purchasing it). To fully exploit the signal in the data of multiple types of behaviors, we perform a joint optimization based on the multi-task learning framework, where the optimization on a behavior is treated as a task. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that NMTR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommender systems that are designed to learn from both single-behavior data and multi-behavior data. Further analysis shows that modeling multiple behaviors is particularly useful for providing recommendation for sparse users that have very few interactions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Inventory Control Optimization via Neural-Nets Based Demand Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A 2-stage predictive decision solution was proposed to solve the inventory control problem in this paper, which consists of forecasting the product demand and making inventory decisions for commodities based on the demand prediction. In the prediction module, the long short-term memory network is adopted to predict the demand for commodities. Associated with the demand predictor, an inventory decision rule was newly proposed. Unlike the conventional methodology to deal with the prediction and decision tasks independently, the demand predictor is trained by minimizing the inventory cost instead of optimizing accuracy-oriented metrics, e.g. mean squared error (MSE). Moreover, an empirical study was performed for the e-commerce sales data from Alibaba. The decision-oriented predictor training was realized and compared with the MSE-oriented training, and the results show our solution can significantly reduce the inventory cost.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Genre-Based Movie Recommender System with XGBoost</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender systems are crucial components of online shopping platforms, as they enhance sales by suggesting relevant products to users. It provides personalized recommendations of products or items depending on the user's preferences, effectively addressing the problem of information overload. The recommender system is an information filtering method that effectively sifts through large volumes of data. Algorithms such as Matrix factorization, K-nearest neighbours, and Convolutional neural networks have already been employed to generate suggestions. This study presents a formulation of the recommendation issue as a supervised model. We employ the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) method to predict the rating score of movies and recommend the highest-rated movie to the user. The model underwent training and testing using the Movilens dataset, surpassing the performance of existing models in terms of precision and recall. It achieved a precision of 0.89, a recall of 0.63, an F-1 score of 0.74, an RMSE of 0.97, and an MAE of 0.78.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Fake Reviews Detection using Support Vector Machine</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>One of the fastest expanding business categories in the world today is internet shopping. People nowadays buy a lot of things from internet shopping sites. Customers can buy a better quality products based on the reviews given by previous buyers of the products. Reviews includes text reviews, ratings and smileys. On a product review there are hundreds of reviews in which some of the reviews would be fake reviews. Opinion mining from natural languages is a difficult method for evaluating customers' sentiments, but sentiment analysis provides the best answer. It provides crucial data for decision-making in a variety of fields. So, we propose a fake reviews detection system using support vector machine which detect the fake reviews of the products. The primary goal is to suggest higher-quality products to the user. We use the support vector machine algorithm to classify the reviews into positive and negative groups. Finally fake reviews are predicted which are posted by the users. The reviews are grouped as negative, positive and neutral. In this system, only purchased users can post the reviews and duplicates are verified based on user id and booking id. Genuine reviews are considered for product recommendation</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Analysis of Visual Product Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the recent shift toward the digital world, online customers are increasing rapidly. To fulfill the market demand, competitive market strategies are introduced in the e-commerce industry. Analyzing customer feedback is becoming one of the integral parts of this market strategy, and indispensable to a service provider. In recent days, it can be noticed that customers upload purchased product images with their review scores. In this article, we undertake the task of analyzing such visual reviews, which is very new of its kind. In the past, the researchers worked on analyzing language feedback. However, here, we do not take any assistance from linguistic reviews that may be absent, since a recent trend can be observed where customers prefer to quickly upload visual feedback through a smartphone instead of typing language feedback. We propose a hierarchical architecture, where the higher-level model engages in product categorization, and the lower-level model pays attention to predicting the review score from a customer-provided product image. We generated a database by procuring real visual product reviews, which was quite challenging. Our architecture obtained some promising results by performing extensive experiments on the employed database. The proposed hierarchical architecture attained a 26.26% more accuracy than the single-level best comparable architecture.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Aspect-Based Fashion Recommendation With Attention Mechanism</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid growth of fashion e-commerce, fashion recommendation has become a main digital marketing tool that is built on customer reviews and ratings. Online review is a powerful source for understanding users’ shopping experiences, preferences and feedbacks on product/item performances, and thus is useful for enhancing personalized recommendations for future purchases. However, most extant fashion recommendation methods lack effective frameworks to integrate local and global aspect representations extracted from customers’ ratings and reviews. In this paper, we proposed an aspect-based fashion recommendation model with attention mechanism (AFRAM) to predict customer ratings based on online reviews of fashion products. This model can extract latent aspect features about users and items separately through two parallel paths of convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and attention mechanisms. One path processes user reviews and the other copes with item reviews. On each path, CNN and LSTM are both coupled with an attention mechanism to capture local aspect features and global aspect features respectively, which are combined through a mutual operation module. The mutual operations on both paths can enhance the generalization of the AFRAM model. The extracted features from the two paths are further merged to predict users’ ratings. Real-world customer reviews and ratings collected from two renowned business websites were used to train and test AFRAM. The experiment results demonstrate that AFRAM is more effective in customer rating predictions, as compared to several state-of-the-art fashion recommenders.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Design and Implementation of Cross-Border E-Commerce ERP System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the continuous development of various technologies such as smart terminals, mobile internet, and the internet, the level of development of e-commerce has significantly improved, which has also played a certain role in promoting the development of the cross-border e-commerce industry. However, as the scale of cross-border e-commerce enterprises expands, the problems they face are gradually becoming prominent, such as the inability to effectively monitor the quality of personal consumer goods, high cross-border express delivery costs due to the long transportation distance and short transportation time limit, and some e-commerce platforms lacking operational data information, which prevents cross-border e-commerce enterprises from developing suitable sales and procurement plans, hindering their normal operations. At the same time, with the development of enterprise business and the expansion of scale, there is also a high demand for ERP systems. By integrating automation and systemization in the system, it can help enterprises to execute business processes and digitize work results and data, thus ensuring the normal operation of enterprises. Therefore, based on the analysis of the requirements of the cross-border e-commerce ERP system, this paper explores the design and implementation of the cross-border e-commerce ERP system to meet the needs of enterprises and achieve long-term development.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Survey On Feature Selection Method For Product Review</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The internet becomes a lot more accessible with the help of wireless technology.a great site to learn online, share ideas, and read reviews for the purpose of a product or service. It may be tough to keep track of and comprehend consumer feedback when there are millions of internet reviews for a product or service.Usersatisfaction can be improved by analyzing the sentiment of a huge number of user reviews on e-commerce sites. A discourse analysis, due to the use of official speech, errors and shorter versions of words in short, results in increasing heterogeneity and sparseness, is hard in short texts. Sentiment analysis uses a set of features derived from meaningful words taken from data. A selection of subsets is the strategy for selecting a subset of important characteristics from a big corpus to improve classification accuracy.In machine learning or pattern recognition applications, feature selection approaches allow us to reduce computation time, improve prediction performance, and gain a deeper knowledge of the data. We offer an overview of some of the methods used in the literature in this study. In this study, we used a few feature selection approaches such as the genetic algorithm, Principal Component Analysis, Forest Optimization Algorithm and particle swarm optimization.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Prediction of Customer Behavior Changing via a Hybrid Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study proposes a hybrid approach to predict customer churn by combining statistic approaches and machine learning models. Unlike traditional methods, where churn is defined by a fixed period of time, the proposed algorithm uses the probability of customer alive derived from the statistical model to dynamically determine the churn line. After observing customer churn through clustering over time, the proposed method segmented customers into four behaviors: new, short-term, high-value, and churn, and selected machine learning models to predict the churned customers. This combination reduces the risk to be misjudged as churn for customers with longer consumption cycles. Two public datasets were used to evaluate the hybrid approach, an online retail of U.K. gift sellers and the largest E-Commerce of Pakistan. Based on the top three learning models, the recall ranged from 0.56 to 0.72 in the former while that ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 in the latter. Results show that the proposed approach enables companies to retain important customers earlier by predicting customer churn. The proposed hybrid method requires less data than existing methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>ENCODE: Ensemble Contextual Bandits in Big Data Settings - A Case Study in E-Commerce Dynamic Pricing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>We present ENCODE, an innovative ensemble-based Contextual Bandit (CB) model, engineered explicitly for dynamic pricing in large-scale e-commerce for kid’s clothing. ENCODE uniquely addresses the retailer’s multifaceted need for optimal pricing – both immediate and cumulative – subject to market-driven price triggers like competitor fluctuations and seasonal trends. The model integrates four cornerstone CB algorithms: LinUCB, Vowpal Wabbit, Contextual Thompson Sampling, and BayesUCB, delivering a unified solution for maximizing yield in alignment with business constraints.Our model’s originality manifests in its comprehensive treatment of complex, real-world pricing issues: from optimizing long-tail products with limited data to seamlessly managing an extensive array of products and catering to diverse customer segments. ENCODE also uniquely accommodates pricing strategies within product families, is highly responsive to shifts in competitor pricing, and accounts for the intricate interplay between related products in a non-stationary environment.Demonstrably effective, the model yielded a 13.8% improvement in margin through Contextual Thompson Sampling alone, with an additional 6% gain from considering inter-related products. In comparative analysis, ENCODE surpassed standalone CB algorithms by 19% in cumulative margins. It also boasts computational efficiency, optimized through dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter fine-tuning. Scalability is ensured through advanced cloud-based implementations. Hence, ENCODE stands as a comprehensive, highly scalable, and markedly effective solution to contemporary e-commerce pricing complexities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Automobile Price Prediction in Turkey Marketplace with Linear Regression</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Automobiles in the late 2000s are huge role players in real life. People try to understand the basic features of automobiles when they decide to buy them. More specifically, when people decide to buy an automobile, they look for the specifications of the automobile like fuel type, engine power, engine capacity, etc. to find the most suitable automobile for the needs and budget. The aim and main responsibility of this study are to make an exploratory data analysis on a specific dataset that consists of automobile specifications within a range of years, to find the relationships between these features and the correlations with the price feature, and to build an automobile price prediction machine learning model with the comparison of real prices and predicted prices at the end of the study. The study is carried on with the dataset that is collected from a Turkey’s automobile seller website arabam.com with a web scraper written in Python. Linear Regression technique is used during the model evaluation phase. It is found that the predicted prices are matched with the real prices with a nearly 75% success rate. Some limitations are applied to both dataset and for the price feature to obtain better results for the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Multi - Variate Feature Selection Framework for Comparing Performance of RNN And LSTM For Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The research addresses the need for automated sentiment analysis (SA) due to the impracticality of manual analysis given the vast amount of online customer feedback. Traditional sentiment analysis methods, which focus on overall sentiment at the sentence or document level, fail to capture detailed insights within customer reviews. To overcome this, the research develops an aspect-level sentiment analysis (ALSA) system using supervised learning techniques. This system aims to identify specific aspects of products or services and evaluate the sentiment expressed towards each aspect, offering a more detailed understanding of customer opinions. The core of the research is a Multivariate Feature Selection Framework for ALSA, which enhances sentiment classification by combining filter and wrapper methods to identify the most relevant features for each aspect. Key components of the framework include Aspect Extraction Using POS tagging and dependency parsing to identify aspects in the text, Feature Extraction for Retaining features that are highly discriminative for aspect-specific sentiment analysis, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Refine the set of features based on its impact on the performance of the machine learning model. The framework is evaluated on benchmark ALSA datasets, showing significant improvements in sentiment classification accuracy over baseline models. It also provides insights into the importance of selected features for different aspects and sentiment polarities, improves accuracy and interpretability, and reduces computational costs by removing redundant features. The ALSA system involves several subtasks, such as extraction of aspects from reviews, extraction of aspects terms, classification of categories, classification of perceived polarity at the aspect level, and calculation of perception score. The approach first extracts aspects and detects sentiment polarity, then extracts relevant features, uses a model for sentiment classification, represents sentiment with a five-point scale, and finally evaluates and calculates the sentiment score. The paper shows a comparison of RNN and LSTM for sentiment analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Topic Modeling-Based Framework for Extracting Marketing Information From E-Commerce Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Reviews left by consumers on e-commerce platforms provide crucial marketing information as they are a publicly available source of information providing insight into consumers’ thoughts and opinions. However, it is physically impossible to read hundreds of reviews per product. Therefore, algorithmically extracting the necessary insights from a large volume of review data can provide more advanced information while reducing time and costs. This study aims to automate the process of extracting related products, pros and cons of products, and trend forecasting from review data using clustering algorithms. The review dataset for pros and cons of products and related products was constructed by selecting 17 products on the Naver Shopping platform and crawling them and the product keyword and search volume dataset for trend forecasting was constructed by crawling the data from Itemscout and Naver datalab platform. Various clustering-based algorithms such as Deep Clustering Network, BERTopic, and a Transformer-based forecasting model were used to conduct the research. It is expected that this will allow for a more accurate understanding of consumer thoughts, which can be utilized in marketing for various products and services.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-Commerce Detectives: A Scam Website Detection Application Using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Many people have chosen to use online-based shopping, which is easy, fast and more accessible to different types of products and services. Some of the popular e-commerce websites nowadays are Shopee, Lazada, eBay, Amazon and Alibaba. These websites serve as a good platform for people to find different kinds of products and services around the world. Most users are younger, ranging in age from 13 to 25 years old. However, some older people love to shop online. Most of them lack exposure to and education on how to tell the difference between a scam and a legitimate website. It is also one of humans’ weaknesses to detect and identify a scam website if it looks the same as a legitimate website. Furthermore, there are numerous reports of scam attacks that result in significant financial losses each year. Scammers may target not just an individual but also a company. At times, the situation can worsen, potentially posing a threat to our families and lives. This study has proposed a web-based scam detector as a solution to verify the legitimacy of an e-commerce website. This prototype uses the Random Forest model as a classifier to detect scams. This is due to the good performance and high accuracy of detection compared to the other algorithms such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine. The Random Forest model achieved 93% accuracy of detection and it is good enough to deploy on the real prototype. Additionally, this website offers guidance on identifying scam websites and the tactics they typically employ to lure victims.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The fast growth of e-commerce markets helps companies bring their products closer to customers and lets users have many choices for online shopping. However, it causes the need to have a proper strategy to keep customers in every company. As a rising solution, sentiment analysis on users’ feedback using artificial intelligence is a timely-fashioned way for business owners to understand their customers and clients, which could help them improve their business against competitors. Therefore, in the scope of our research, we introduce our results on the task of customers’ review sentiment analysis using the dataset provided in the Fashion and Beauty Review Rating (one competition organized in Kaggle), where our solution reached first place with a score of 0.51269 RMSE. Our proposed solution combines deep learning models (Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit, Convolutional Neural Network) and a rule-based method (a method that uses linguistic rules to predict the rating of reviews). We can describe the solution in this paper with the support of analysis techniques to give more insightful points.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-commerce Platform Product Recommendation Algorithm Combining SVM Algorithm and Attention Mechanism</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The recommendation system of e-commerce platform is an important link to improve user experience and promote orders. This paper first improves the recommendation algorithm, then designs data preprocessing and feature engineering for machine learning algorithm, and demonstrates the model construction process. Finally, through carefully designed data stream processing, feature selection and model training, the recommendation system can truly understand and predict complex user behavior patterns. It can be seen from the experimental data that the recommended coverage rate of the system is stable at 81.2%-98.4%, which proves that the system has a wide range of products for users to recommend. At the same time, after adopting the attention mechanism, the accuracy of the system is rapidly improved, and the accuracy of the recommendation system will reach 99.5%. To sum up, this paper further optimizes the parameter structure and algorithm of the model, and optimizes the system security. The high load performance is due to its limited space.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendation algorithm for agricultural products based on attention factor decomposer and knowledge graph</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To alleviate the distress of data sparsity and cold start in agricultural products e-commerce platforms, this paper proposes an agricultural products recommendation algorithm based on the combination of attention factor decomposer and knowledge graph. The algorithm constructs a knowledge graph for the produce dataset, models the higher-order connectivity of the produce knowledge graph in an end-to-end manner under the space of the knowledge graph, recursively propagates embeddings from the neighbors of the nodes, and extracts the potential feature vectors of the produce by using the attention factor decomposer as the message aggregation of the neighboring nodes. Using MLP, the agricultural product feature vectors and user embedding vectors are integrated and sent to the prediction module, and user click-through rate prediction is obtained by vector inner product operation. Experimenting on an agricultural e-commerce dataset, the ACC and AUC are improved by 1.60% and 1.14%, respectively, compared with the optimal baseline model KGCN. Thus, it verifies the effectiveness as well as feasibility of the improved algorithm on agricultural products data, which can provide a new idea and method for agricultural products e-commerce platform.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Evaluating customer usage and satisfaction in Bahrain towards AI-enabled e-commerce websites</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of technology, online shopping has become popular, especially in countries with high internet penetration rates. In Bahrain, the internet penetration rate reached 99 percent, which directly impacts the e-commerce market's revenue, which is projected to reach USD 1.434 million in 2022. The use of artificial intelligence in e-commerce helps businesses to target customers better and generate sales. Knowing that customers are using the AI features as predicted and satisfied with them is very significant for online businesses to assist them while adjusting their marketing strategies. This study aimed to measure customer usage and satisfaction in Bahrain towards the AI features in the two largest global e-commerce platforms – Amazon and Alibaba. The study focused on the most common AI features used in e-commerce websites: recommendation systems, chatbots, virtual assistants, search engines, image recognition technology, augmented reality, and product reviews. It also examined if customer’s demographic attributes, namely, age, gender, and highest education level, influence the levels of customer usage and satisfaction. The IS Success Model was adapted to formulate the research model and hypotheses. Using a CSAT survey, data were collected from a random sample of 126 Bahraini customers. The findings were analyzed using Pearson coefficient, T-Test paired samples, and one-way ANOVA. The results showed differences in usage, customer satisfaction, and purchase experience. It also demonstrated that the demographic attributes and different business strategies might affect the use, customer satisfaction, and purchase experience. Managerial implications are discussed based on the results of the study.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A IoT-Based Framework for Cross-Border E-Commerce Supply Chain Using Machine Learning and Optimization</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the expansion of communication technologies and their impact on trade patterns, e-commerce strategies have also undergone significant changes. Adapting to these changes necessitates the utilization of artificial intelligence techniques to automate a wide range of processes and further develop e-commerce. This article employs a combination of machine learning techniques and multi-objective optimization to enhance the supply chain performance in Cross-Border E-Commerce (CBEC). To achieve this, a framework for intelligent CBEC based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology is proposed. By deploying machine learning models within this framework, efforts are made to improve supply chain performance through demand volume prediction. The predictive model used in the proposed method is an ensemble system based on Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), which employs weighted averaging to predict demand volume for each retail unit. The configuration of this prediction model is done at two levels, utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization. At the first level, the hyperparameters of each ANFIS model are optimized, and at the second level, the weight values of each learning component are optimized using this algorithm. The performance of this predictive model in enhancing the CBEC supply chain structure is evaluated using real-world data. Based on the results, the proposed predictive model achieves an average absolute error of 2.54 in demand volume prediction, showcasing a minimum reduction of 8.58% compared to previous research. Moreover, the improvement in supply chain performance through this model will lead to reduced delays and increased efficiency in CBEC, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Multi-modal Approach of Sentiment Analysis on Samsung Cell Phone Review</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Sentiment analysis, the scientific art of understanding human emotions. The motive of sentiment analysis is to extract and predict human emotions and sentiment through text, speech or facial expressions. It is proposed an integrated study that uses text review given by buyers of Samsung phones at Amazon to analyze sentiments and satisfaction towards a Samsung phone. In research, it has been seen that potential customers look for text reviews besides numeric rating to get an overview of positive and negative impressions of the product. This research helps to get critical insights for analyzing customers’ text review and giving a sentiment score for a specific text review by sentiment analysis algorithmic model. This research compares numeric and text reviews based on sentiment scores and predicts overall customer sentiment based on a text review’s sentiment score. The objective of this research is to analyze customer’s sentiment on Samsung cell phone using a multimodal approach (TextBlob, VADER, and LSTM). It extracted positive and negative features of Samsung brand or product as per buyers’ opinion, which is called opinion mining using Word Cloud dictionary library of NLP. Applied LDA model for topic modeling, used XGBoost to extract feature importance for sentiment classification, implemented VADER and TextBlob algorithm for sentiment analysis, and tested accuracy to VADER and TextBlob, applying LSTM for sentiment prediction.The research’s implication is that both customers and brand understand the recent market trends directly through the customer’s sentiment. Customers can decide to buy or not a product; the brand can find out where to improve a product.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Estimating the cost of dining for two: An Integration of Sentiment Analysis and Feature Based Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In rapidly growing food industry, where more than 1200 orders are processed in a minute, it is essential for owners to optimize their services. This study focuses into the food industry and analyzes the approximate cost for two people along with the sentimental analysis using the data taken from Zomato. The approximate cost for two is based on various factors like restaurants location, availability of online ordering, table booking facilities, restaurant ratings and, cuisines offered. Since there is huge competition among restaurants, so some fake reviews can also be posted. Sentimental analysis is applied to check if the review posted is genuine or fake. Results found that there are around 10k fake reviews out of 51k total reviews. Various regression algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and others are used to calculate approximate cost for two. Also, various classification algorithms like Naïve Bayes, Support Vector, and others are used to verify sentiment analysis. The regression problem is analyzed using two different approaches: first by considering all the features and second by reducing the features by using Principal Component Analysis. Various computation metrics for regression as well as classification are computed, and the results are incorporated.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Improved Decision Support for Product Returns using Probabilistic Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product returns are not only costly for e-tailers, but the unnecessary transports also impact the environment. Consequently, online retailers have started to formulate policies to reduce the number of returns. Determining when and how to act is, however, a delicate matter, since a too harsh approach may lead to not only the order being cancelled, but also the customer leaving the business. Being able to accurately predict which orders that will lead to a return would be a strong tool, guiding which actions to be taken. This paper addresses the problem of data-driven product return prediction, by conducting a case study using a large real-world data set. The main results are that well-calibrated probabilistic predictors are essential for providing predictions with high precision and reasonable recall. This implies that utilizing calibrated models to predict some instances, while rejecting to predict others can be recommended. In practice, this would make it possible for a decision-maker to only act upon a subset of all predicted returns, where the risk of a return is very high.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning Driven Forecasting and Marketing Optimization Platform for Sustainable Agriculture</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Farmers face significant challenges with unpredictable grain pricing and crop selection due to inefficient systems. Current methods often fail to provide accurate insights into grain quality, market trends, and optimal planting choices, which can reduce profitability. Agrico addresses these issues by integrating moisture detection, price prediction, and crop recommendation systems using advanced machine learning Agrico uses a sensor-based system to measure grain moisture levels precisely, allowing farmers to assess crop quality in real time. Accurate moisture detection helps farmers sell their produce at optimal times, as moisture content influences market value. Additionally, Agrico employs a linear regression model for predicting next-day grain prices by analysing historical data. With a model accuracy of 95%, this tool enables farmers to anticipate market trends and make informed decisions on when to sell their grains for the highest profits. Agrico’s crop recommendation system further enhances farming decisions by suggesting suitable crops based on geolocation and soil analysis. By considering local soil conditions and market demand, it helps farmers increase productivity and sustainability. With machine learning models offering 95% accuracy, Agrico provides reliable, real-time insights that enhance profitability and decision-making. This innovative, data-driven approach transforms traditional farming, improving efficiency and fostering transparency in the agricultural marketplace. Agrico empowers farmers to navigate market uncertainties, optimize their strategies, and engage in sustainable farming practices for long-term success.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-commerce Gamification Applications User Churn Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the e-commerce and retail sector, customer retention has become a challenging and competitive field, considering the current competitive environment. Various applications, including gamification, are being implemented to increase customer loyalty and minimize customer losses. Gamification applications, incorporating elements such as rewards and scoring, can enhance customer interaction on e-commerce platforms and promote customer loyalty. From this perspective, the use of these applications and the continuation of customer engagement are crucial for the e-commerce sector. This article includes a binary classification prediction model that predicts whether customers who have used gamification applications on the Hepsiburada platform will continue to use these applications in the future, along with the model’s details. This model can help e-commerce platforms predict potential losses, enabling them to take preemptive actions before churn occurs to prevent the loss. The input features used in model training include demographic information of customers, past shopping behavior on the platform, counts, volumes, recency, and qualitative information about product views, game and campaign interactions. In the training of models, Decision Tree Classifier, Multi-layer Perceptron, LightGBM Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbor Classifier model algorithms have been used and compared. It has been concluded that the random forest algorithm, which yielded the highest result, is an ideal algorithm to use in this field.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Shopee Price Match Guarantee Algorithm based on multimodal learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Shopee has been a popular online shopping website in the Southeast Asia. Customers appreciate its easy, secure, and fast online shopping experience tailored to their region. At the same time, it allows customers to choose the one with the lower price of the same product. It relies on the product matching, that is the same product with the same description image must be removed. The base technology to achieve this function is multimodal learning, in which we focus on the images and text. In our article, we proposed a new multimodal learning model mainly based on transformer and BERT. For image matching, we use NFNet, Swin_Transformer and Efficientnet to get image embeddings. For text matching, we use Distil-Bert, Albert, Multilingual Bert and TF-IDF to get text embeddings. After we get the embedding vector, we choose KNN to classify. We use cosine and distance to measure the similarity of the different models. It is worth mentioning that the loss function is Arcface, not the traditional Softmax, which improve the difficulty of training to ensure the final performance in the test periods. In addition, 7 models vote for the final results ensuring the effect of prediction. To avoid the bad matching result, we add some postprocessing process.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Tackling an Unbalanced Dataset for Classifying Indonesian E-Commerce Reviews Using Multi Word Embedding Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product reviews are an integral part of ecommerce. By Q2 2020 alone, the average of e-commerce visitors in Indonesia almost reached 400 million. This vast amount of traffic resulting a massive amount of product review information. Product reviews in Indonesia are usually paired with a rating system from one to five based on user satisfaction with the product. Mostly, the number of reviews in each rating is unbalanced. Ratings 5, 4, and 1 are usually more frequent than ratings 2 and 3. This imbalanced data makes classification challenging to categorize the review rating, leading to inaccurate predictions for the rating with fewer data than the others. Previous research used various approaches for classifying review ratings, such as machine learning and fine-tuning a state-of-the-art deep learning model. In this research, we propose a new approach that leverages multiple-word embedding combined with CNN to deal with the highly unbalanced dataset problem. By leveraging multiple-word embedding techniques, the model can extract more features from the review text. We also proposed an extended pipeline to enhance the model performance. The proposed model and pipeline perform better than the fine-tuned Indonesian BERT-based and RoBERTa-based pre-trained models baseline with 0.93 accuracy and 0.82 F1-Macro scores.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Examining Customer Satisfaction Through Transformer-Based Sentiment Analysis for Improving Bilingual E-Commerce Experiences</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As e-commerce continues its rapid expansion, accurately gauging and interpreting customer sentiment has become critical for optimizing user satisfaction and predicting purchasing behavior. This study advances feature-level sentiment analysis by examining Chinese e-commerce product reviews, translated into English, to uncover the contextual impact of sentiment-bearing keywords across diverse product categories. The research intends to discover trends, reasons, and broad conclusions associated with the volume, co-occurrence, and contextual use of keywords across various product types. Using sentiment intensity analysis, N-gram modeling, and machine learning, this research attempted to evaluate the performance of these models: ELECTRA, BERT, BiLSTM, Random Forest with XGBoost, and SVC with SGD. Empirical results demonstrate that ELECTRA yields the highest accuracy (98.09%) and F1 score (0.9711), illustrating superior performance in capturing nuanced sentiment cues, with low loss of 0.062. BiLSTM followed with 96.09% accuracy and F1 score of 0.9583. Although BERT performed strongly with an accuracy of 95.28% and an F1 score of 0.9528, it is extremely resource demanding. Ensemble methods like Random Forest with XGBoost and SVC with SGD had moderate performance, finding 82.43%, and 88.84% accuracy, respectively, but had better runtimes. The results supports the advantage of using transformer based models in attempting more sophisticated contextual analysis by uncovering paramount sentiment patterns, product specific issues, and customer needs. Furthermore, by translating Chinese reviews into English, the study highlights the potential for cross-lingual frameworks to enrich global e-commerce strategies. Future research directions include integrating cultural factors, extending analysis to additional languages, and refining computational approaches for resource-limited environments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Economic Forecasting of New Zealand with Electronic Card Transaction Data Using Machine Learning Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Electronic card transactions encompass various economic activities like retail sales, e-commerce, and business services, offering a comprehensive view of consumer spending essential for forecasting overall economic activity. Policymakers and investors are increasingly interested in reliable high-frequency indicators to track real-time economic conditions. This study evaluates the economic forecasting performance of several machine learning (ML) models using New Zealand data from January 2023 to May 2024. ML models can quickly process large data volumes, enabling near-real-time forecasting of economic variables, facilitating timely decisions for businesses and policymakers. Our results reveal that linear regression (R^2=0.99), Lasso (R^2=0.99), decision tree regressors (R^2=0.99), and OLS regressor (R^2=0.98) outperformed random forest regressor (R^2=0.30), KNN (R^2=0.06), and XGBoost (R^2=0.13). Overall, using electronic card transaction data with ML models enhances the accuracy, timeliness, and granularity of economic forecasts, providing valuable insights for stakeholders.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>On a Machine Learning Based Method for Store Clustering</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Since the consuming behavior of customers is hard to predict and most data is diversified and unclassified in the real world, it is of great importance to collect those data and analyze them so as to improve the promotion strategy and total profit for business activity. To solve this problem, an unsupervised model in machine learning is utilized to analyze the transaction dataset and then classify the stores into multiple groups. A particular example dataset of a shopping mall is represented to demonstrate that the proposed model is correct and effective.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Incorporating Human Body Shape Guidance for Cloth Warping in Model to Person Virtual Try-on Problems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The world of retail has witnessed a lot of change in the last few decades and with a size of 2.4 trillion, the fashion industry is way ahead of others in this aspect. With the blessings of technology like virtual try-on (vton), now even online shoppers can virtually try a product before buying. However, the current image-based virtual try-on methods still have a long way to go when it comes to producing realistic outputs. In general, vton methods work in two stages. The first stage warps the source cloth and the second stage merges the cloth with the person image for predicting the final try-on output. While the second stage is comparatively easier to handle using neural networks, predicting an accurate warp is difficult as replicating actual human body deformation is challenging. A fundamental issue in vton domain is data. Although lots of images of cloth are available over the internet in either social media or e-commerce websites, but most of them are in the form of a human wearing the cloth. However, the existing approaches are constrained to take separate cloth images as the input source clothing. To address these problems, we propose a model to person cloth warping strategy, where the objective is to align the segmented cloth from the model image in a way that fits the target person, thus, alleviating the need of separate cloth images. Compared to the existing approaches of warping, our method shows improvement especially in the case of complex patterns of cloth. Rigorous experiments applied on various public domain datasets establish the efficacy of this method compared to benchmark methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Energy Prosumer for Local Energy Marketplace</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper describes the creation of a new role - Energy Prosumer. It considers instances when generated energy is distributed via commercial PV and home usage. The authors explore how a blockchain system can improve the process of electricity exchange and show a prediction of the households' power profiles with the blockchain process. An original multi-agent system was designed and tested with Transactive Energy (TE) and Distributed Energy Resources (DER). The prediction process of blockchain-based LEMs is usually accepted as given, but it needs to be reliable for effective LEMs. Therefore, an LSTM forecasting model is proposed for reliable prediction results, and this model was implemented in the blockchain system. Results show that the proposed LEMs could deliver excellent and stable predictions and efficient blockchain architecture. Generally, this study has demonstrated how blockchain can improve electricity exchange and the advantages of reliable short-term forecasts. The outcomes could provide an effective way to manage electricity exchange and production.11Some of the material discussed in this paper is the advanced results of work previously described in [2] and [11].</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-Commerce Customer Segmentation and Precision Marketing Strategy Based on Cluster Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of e-commerce, customer segmentation and precision marketing have become important strategies for enterprises to enhance their competitiveness. Traditional marketing methods often rely on simple demographic characteristics, making it difficult to meet the increasingly diverse needs of customers. This article used the k-means clustering analysis method to segment e-commerce customers, aiming to provide data support for enterprises to develop personalized marketing strategies. This article collected multidimensional data from customers, iteratively assigns customers to the nearest center by selecting multiple initial center points, and updated the center points until convergence. Research showed that personalized marketing significantly improved customer conversion rates, with potential customers achieving a conversion rate of 41% in the sixth month, which was 36 % higher than the first month's 5 %. Cluster analysis provides effective methodological support for e-commerce customer segmentation and precision marketing, promoting the adaptability and competitive advantage of enterprises in dynamic market environments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Companies Adoption Of IoT For Smart Retailing In Industry 4.0</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Around the world, the retail industry is drastically changing, because of the development of the Internet. Retailers are growing better approaches to associate with clients and client channels. It is predicted that in the coming years the Internet will be playing a much crucial job to regular day to day existence. Soon we will be living in a world where non-living objects are connected with each other and have computing capabilities, hence creating so-called `smart objects'. This smart component across a wide range of technologies and services is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Literature shows that retailers are regularly more connectors of advancement, as opposed to innovate themselves. They are centered around making new products, as opposed to developing their services. The idea of service-based advancement is a fairly under searched territory. This paper focuses around how the Internet of Things permits retailers to improve their services in new manners by taking a gander at the key drivers of advancement in the retail business. Based on extensive literature review and experts inputs it can be concluded that the Internet of Things is very extensive tool to enhance innovation in the service-based retail industry. It gives a new innovative method that upgrades the regular shopping experience, by making it all the simpler, fun, intuitive and more customized.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI Assisted Customer Review Sentiment Analysis and Department Classification Tool</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Sentiment analysis is a crucial technique in electronic commerce as it enables businesses to understand customer opinions and emotions about products or services. By analyzing customer reviews, a company can enhance a product or service, improve customer satisfaction, adjust marketing strategies, and even increase sales by addressing negative comments. Accordingly, this study proposes an artificial i ntelligence integrated Python application to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews to determine whether the review is positive, neutral, or negative. Moreover, a department classification m odel is also proposed to match each customer review to its potential department, such as logistics, sales, etcetera. For evaluation purposes, a benchmark study is utilized. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 93.7% while deciding the sentiment of a particular review. On the other hand, the department classification model achieves an accuracy of 93%. Furthermore, a user-friendly Python application is developed to make the models more accessible and easy to use.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Customer Behaviour Analysis and Personalized Marketing using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with eXtreme Gradient Boosting</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, e-commerce business evolved rapidly due to rise in smart shopping platforms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) advertisements. Predicting the customers purchase intent is important in this era for recommending best products and increasing purchase conversions. Even though, previous researchers have suggested various advanced model, but still there are challenges like inability to handle complex customer interactions and identify meaningful patterns in sequential data. Therefore, this research proposes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (BiLSTM-XGBoost) for accurately predicting customer purchase intent. Initially, data is collected from publicly available e-commerce customers sales-record dataset, which consists customers past purchasing behaviour data. This collected data is pre-processed by using Min-Max normalization for ensuring all numerical features are transformed within a standardized range, and using mahalanobis distance for outlier detection. After that, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for selecting relevant features from pre-processed data. Finally, BiLSTMXG-Boost is employed, in which BiLSTM obtains sequential patterns from customer behaviour by capturing both past and future dependencies while XGBoost classifies data for accurate purchase intent predictions. The proposed BiLSTM-XGBoost achieved better results in terms of accuracy (98.15%), precision (98.50%), Recall (97.81%) and F1-Score (97.11%) respectively when compared to existing LSTM.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Customer Behaviour Analysis and Personalized Marketing Using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with Extreme Gradient Boosting</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, e-commerce business evolved rapidly due to rise in smart shopping platforms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) advertisements. Predicting the customers purchase intent is important in this era for recommending best products and increasing purchase conversions. Even though, previous researchers have suggested various advanced model, but still there are challenges like inability to handle complex customer interactions and identify meaningful patterns in sequential data. Therefore, this research proposes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (BiLSTM-XGBoost) for accurately predicting customer purchase intent. Initially, data is collected from publicly available e-commerce customers sales-record dataset, which consists customers past purchasing behaviour data. This collected data is pre-processed by using Min-Max normalization for ensuring all numerical features are transformed within a standardized range, and using mahalanobis distance for outlier detection. After that, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for selecting relevant features from pre-processed data. Finally, BiLSTMXGBoost is employed, in which BiLSTM obtains sequential patterns from customer behaviour by capturing both past and future dependencies while XGBoost classifies data for accurate purchase intent predictions. The proposed BiLSTM-XGBoost achieved better results in terms of accuracy (98.15%), precision (98.50%), Recall (97.81%) and F1-Score (97.11%) respectively when compared to existing LSTM.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing E-Commerce Sentiment Analysis: An Ensemble Approach To Addressing Contextual Data Imbalance</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Sentiment analysis plays a vital role in managing product quality in e-commerce. Customers rely on reviews to gauge others’ opinions about products. However, existing sentiment analysis models face several challenges. These include difficulties in capturing the complexity and context of language, leading to reduced accuracy. The imbalanced datasetswhere one sentiment class dominates-pose a challenge, often resulting in biased classification. This paper proposes a hybrid model combining BERT, SMOTE, and VADER to address these challenges. BERT provides a deep understanding of local and global dependencies in text, SMOTE generates synthetic data to address class imbalance, and VADER provides labels for fine tuning BERT. As ensemble they improve sentiment classification accuracy and reduce bias. We conducted experiments on a realtime dataset of e-commerce product reviews, covering various product categories and sentiment distributions. The proposed model achieved 99.19 % accuracy outperforming traditional machine learning models along with high F1 scores, precision, and recall metrics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Factors Affecting the Use of Online Recommendation Systems in E-Commerce in Croatia</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The concept of utilizing IT for recommendations has existed since the inception of computer science, but it has become more prevalent in recent years as e-commerce has grown significantly. Because recommendation systems are effective at simulating customer behaviour and offering users personalisation, they have helped numerous e-commerce and content providers expand. In order to determine what influences customers’ adoption and usage of online purchase recommendation systems, this research explores the factors affecting recommendation systems’ adoption and use in e-commerce in Croatia. The structural model of partial least squares and the Unified Theory of Adoption and Use of Technology (UTAUT) were employed to accomplish this goal (PLS). 130 users of online recommendation systems made up the sample. Research has shown that users will only utilize recommendations if they are given supplementary goods that improve their purchasing experience. Users trust recommendation systems (43%), but they have reservations about whether they deliver on their promises which is related to the fact that only a small number of retailers track and evaluate the effectiveness of recommendation systems in their online stores.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Revolutionizing E-Commerce With Consumer-Driven Energy-Efficient WSNs: A Multi-Characteristics Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a significant role by collecting and analyzing real-time data on consumer behavior, product availability, and other environmental factors, thus enhancing e-commerce operations. Researchers in the domain of consumer electronics are working actively to increase the sustainability of WSNs and decrease their ecological footprint by developing energy-efficient algorithms, data compression techniques, and sensor designs. These advancements are directed toward optimizing energy consumption and minimizing environmental consequences while ensuring the smooth functionality of IoT applications. Organizations are emphasizing the need for collaboration between designers, business organizations, developers, and regulatory authorities to implement eco-friendly industrial laws to enhance the effectiveness of the e-commerce industry. Decision-making in the e-commerce sector is complicated by information overload, subjectivity of preferences, trust issues, product variety, lack of personalized assistance, return and exchange concerns, dynamic pricing and discounts, limited sensory experience, and complex decision-making processes. To address these challenges, an entropy-based multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed to assist personalization in e-commerce and improve user interfaces, recommendation systems, product information transparency, and consumer trust. The utilization of the MCDM technique facilitates the customization of electronic commerce platforms, whereby affordable products can be identified and retrieved according to individual user preferences. The study investigates the impact of electronic gadgets and energy-efficient WSNs on inventory management, customer preferences, and online shopping sustainability, highlighting the intricate relationship between data privacy, energy efficiency, and governance. The proposed method is compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies and shown to be effective under various criteria.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Model and Popularity Based Recommendation System- A Collaborative Filtering Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A recommendation system (RS) is a crucial application in the modern world, however it’s still unclear if recommendations can be effective and accurate. Collaborative filtering has been used for many years to improve and increase the accuracy of recommendations. Although numerous strategies have been employed, such as content-based filtering and deep learning, collaborative filtering models can identify new interests between users and items without the need for specialized knowledge. The new user problem known as cold start using user ratings can be solved by collaborative filtering, which uses item ratings to predict user preference and is effective to predict better than traditional algorithms and popularity-based approach. A product is referred to as popular by the most user ratings in one specific product. The Daraz ecommerce website, which includes four characteristics, is where we got the data for our study. For this analysis, we used Modelbased Collaborative Filtering and Popularity-based approach to solve issues like cold start and data sparsity where we use Matrix factorization and K-means clustering including Truncated SVD and TF-IDF Vectorizer as algorithm to find user and item relation for better and more effective product recommendation. This study will assist to explore how recommendation systems are employed, their many approaches, and the specific algorithms and methodologies we used in our methodology, all of which may aid in providing a thorough understanding of recommendation systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Product Success Evaluation Model Based on Star Ratings, Reviews and Product Popularity</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the era of the Internet and big data, it is of great significance to formulate product sales strategies and product improvement plans based on user evaluation data. Therefore, an evaluation system is established to calculate the index (product success index) composed of three factors: actual star rating of consumers, star rating of review analysis, and star rating of product popularity (star rating of products over time). We use AHP to determine the weights between these three factors. We then select the products we consider most successful based on the calculated product success index and found that users are most concerned about product quality, price and security. At the same time, to solve the question of whether a particular review affects subsequent ratings. We used a two-way ANOVA method to analyze whether specific reviews in the early stages would affect the stars in later stages. We found that the p-value is concentrated between 0.1-0.2, which means the specific star rating is considered to have an impact on the evaluation. Finally, we suggest that Merchants and platforms should pay more attention to the characteristics of successful products and early product feedback. The innovation of this paper is that it combines a variety of methods including systems science, management science, and statistical prediction artificial intelligence to comprehensively evaluate and predict the success of commodities, which can provide certain support for business decisions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommender System for E-Commerce Application based on Deep Collaborative Conjunctive Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, recommender systems play a crucial role in human lives. The recommendation process is involved in many items and many users' decision is based on this process. Collaborative filtering technique is one of the widely applied techniques in various types of recommender systems that uses the reviews of products and services. Word2Vec is adopted to extract information from the users' comments made on the items they bought. To group the items into definite sets, the clustering algorithm is used. A deep collaborative conjunctive recommender (DCCR), which is a hybrid approach. It consists of the combination of an autoencoder which extract the user and item features along with a multilayered perceptron which represents the interaction them. By applying together, the modern technique of deep learning and the traditional technique of collaborative filtering, the proposed system extract some set of the features like the features from users, explicit and implicit ratings to items along with user information. The proposed system uses real-world datasets to achieve effectiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Improving Shopping Mall Revenue by Real-Time Customized Digital Coupon Issuance</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of big data and deep learning technology, big data and deep learning technology have also been applied to the marketing field, which was a part of business administration. Customer churn management is one of the most important areas of marketing. In this paper, we proposed a method to prevent customer churn and increase purchase conversion rate by issuing customized discount coupons to customers with high churn rate based on big data in real time. After segmenting customer segments with two-dimensional segment analysis, a real-time churn rate estimation model based on clickstream data was generated for each segment. After that, we issued customized coupons to our customers. Finally, we tested the conversion rate and sales growth. A two-dimensional cluster analysis-based churn rate estimation combined with a recommendation system was found to be significantly more useful than the respective simple models. Using this proposed model, it is possible to increase sales by automatically estimating the customer’s churn probability and shopping propensity without the burden of marketing costs in the online shopping mall.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Latent Customer Flow Model for Interpretable Predictions of Check-In Counts</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Location-based services, such as Foursquare, Google Places, and Yelp, offer rich data on places that users visit, i. e., check-ins from points-of-interest (POIs). By mining check-in data, one can make predictions regarding the expected number of check-ins that new POIs will generate. Such predictions are highly relevant for location planning at both companies and public bodies (i. e., to estimate the expected customer visits of retail sites or public facilities). In this work, we propose a new machine learning approach for modeling check-in counts with the distinctive property of being highly interpretable. Specifically, our objective is to model the latent customer flow between retail site locations. To this end, we model the expected check-in count such that it is lowered due to competition among nearby POIs, while additional check-ins can be attracted when customers transition among complementary POIs. Our latent customer flow model is then extended by additional sources of spatial heterogeneity. The model is demonstrated based on data from 2.7 million user check-ins from retail stores across three different cities. As a result, our model yields accurate predictions of check-in counts while simultaneously achieving a high degree of interpretability. The latter is achieved by deriving a tailored multi-variate fixed-point iteration.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multiple-structure Attentional Network for Click-through Prediction in Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, the total amount of data generated by people has increased exponentially, which makes it a great problem to recommend for users, so recommendation system (RS) plays an important role in this process, and it has been widely used in many online service fields such as e-commerce system and science and technology (S &amp; T) service platform. As an important part of the RS, CTR prediction has been studied in depth, from the beginning, machine learning methods include logistic regression (LR), factorization machines (FM) and field-aware factorization machines (FFM) models, to deep learning methods such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), product-based neural network (PNN), deepFM and xdeepFM models, and later attention mechanism based methods such as AFM and DIN models, they all lack the application of S &amp; T service platform. The multiple-structure attention (Mul-AN) network model is proposed in this paper integrates the low-order as well as explicit and implicit feature interactions without any manual feature engineering for the data, and introduces the attention mechanism into the embedding layer of the model to distinguish the importance of the interaction of different feature, and will be finally applied it to the Hainan Comprehensive S &amp; T Service Platform. Extensive experiments verify that the model can improve the performance and accuracy of S &amp; T service platform CTR prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimizing Brand Equity Through Predictive Analytics: A Data-Driven Framework for Masstige Marketing and Consumer Insights</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the era of big data, an abundance of consumer information exists; nevertheless, utilizing this data to understand client behavioural preferences presents a considerable challenge. A data-driven approach is proposed to address essential issues related to masstige marketing, highlighting price sensitivity. A machine learning framework is developed, yielding a unified model that integrates transactional RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) variables, behavioural dimensions derived from consumer interactions, and several demographic measures. RFM is documented at the transactional level, whereas customer interactions are measured by metrics such as active seconds, product views, product searches, session participation, interaction duration, and interaction view count. Clustering methods like K-means enable the discovery of similar customers; after labelling the clusters, the resulting labels aid in classification using multinomial logistic regression and in deriving behavioural characteristics. A 2017 case study employing data from a fashion e-commerce company provided findings that necessitated an exploration of predictive analytics. Five Cs are presented, and research deficiencies are outlined in relation to consumer behaviour and brand identity theories. The findings from the price sensitivity study demonstrate the importance shoppers place on unique brands and premium products. A innovative technique is proposed to re-engage inactive customers and enhance brand equity in fashion e-commerce. The results provide suggestions for branding and marketing tactics. Both targeted and broad metrics were identified and examined utilizing the proposed methodology.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>User Product Recommendation System Using KNN-Means and Singular Value Decomposition</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the course of our regular lives, each and every one of us frequently makes use of the e-commerce websites in order to purchase a variety of goods. These results in a rising diversity of consumer demand, which makes it difficult for a retail company to deliver the appropriate products in accordance to the tastes of its customers. These e-commerce websites make use of a variety of recommendation systems in order to give the consumer a satisfying experience when they are shopping online. A technique that may be used to overcome this obstacle is called a recommender system. With the help of product recommendation, it is possible to meet the requirements of customers, which assists in sustaining loyal clients while also attracting new customers. In this project, we propose a system for product based recommendation by using hybrid machine learning algorithms which consists of the combination of KNN-Means and Singular Value Decomposition for the purpose of improving the overall excellence of our rating and recommendation system, that improvises the disadvantages of collaborative filtering on their own. This method has the benefit that there is no necessity for the development of a brand new algorithm in order to calculate the forecasts. The trials demonstrate that our strategy can provide superior outcomes, and our integrated model provides an exceptionally high level of accurate predictions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Utilizing Ensemble Approach for Predictive Customer Clustering Analysis with Unsupervised Cluster Labeling</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customer clustering is an unsupervised machine-learning approach that groups diverse customers based on shared characteristics. This research focuses on improving customer cluster analysis in the retail sector through an exploration of machine learning techniques, specifically employing the k-means model and predictive algorithms. An Ensemble approach is proposed to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and predict the future actions of new customers within the same cluster assignment. The study evaluates multiple machine learning techniques, utilizing K-fold cross-validation for enhanced model performance, with key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Notably, the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier excels in Dataset One, while Random Forest outperforms in Dataset Two. The project aims to combine these top-performing ensemble classifiers using the Voting-Soft Classifier for customer classification. The proposed model achieves high precision scores for both datasets, with a particularly promising precision score of 94.57% and an F1-score of 93% for Dataset Two, demonstrating its effectiveness in customer classification.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Image-Based Service Recommendation System: A JPEG-Coefficient RFs Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online shopping platforms are growing at an unprecedented rate all over the world. These platforms mostly rely on search engines, which are still primarily based on the knowledge-base and use keywords matching for finding similar products. However, customers want an interactive setup that is convenient and reliable for querying related products. In this paper, we propose a novel idea of searching for products in an online shopping system using an image-based approach. A user can provide, select, or click an image, and similar image-based products will be presented to the user. The proposed recommendation system is based on content-based image retrieval and is composed of two major phases; Phase 1 and Phase 2. In Phase 1, the proposed approach learns the class/type of the product. In Phase 2, the proposed recommendation system retrieves closely matched similar products. For Phase 1, the proposed approach creates a model of products using Machine Learning (ML). The model is then used to find the category of the test products. From the ML perspectives, we employ the Random Forests (RF) classifier, and for feature extraction, we use the JPEG coefficients. The dataset used for proof of concepts includes 20 categories of products. For image-based recommendation, the proposed RF model is evaluated for Phase 1 and Phase 2. In Phase 1, the evaluation of the proposed model generates a 75% accurate model. For performance enhancements, the RF model has been integrated into the Deep Learning (DL) setup achieving 84% accurate predictions. Based on the custom evaluation approach for Phase 2, the proposed recommendation approach achieves 98% correct recommendations, thus demonstrating its efficacy for the product recommendation in practical applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Recommendation Technology of Mobile E-Commerce Platform Based on Collaborative Filtering Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the advent of the era of big data, the information data is exploding. How to dig the hidden value and information matching from the massive information data is a far-reaching research topic. In China's 13th Five-Year Plan, the state has included the analysis and application of big data in the national strategic level, and data is value. Under the background of big data, e-commerce has entered a more diversified information development era, and people's recognition of e-commerce is increasing day by day. Online shopping has gradually become an indispensable part of life. Taobao, JD.COM and other platforms are deeply involved in the C2C field, and their own growth has also changed the traditional commercial marketing mode, thus promoting the sustained and vigorous development of domestic e-commerce business. The progress of the industry has brought great profits and convenience, but the challenges it faces are becoming increasingly severe. The key problems are as follows: First, the problem of &quot;data overload&quot;. The booming business of e-commerce makes the data of related users and commodities explode, and it is increasingly difficult for e-commerce users to find the required information in time and accurately from the complicated data. Second, the problem of &quot;cold start&quot;. The new user has no corresponding historical behavior data for the time being, and the platform can't recommend suitable products to him through prediction, that is, the user starts cold. Cold start of goods is the same. The background of e-commerce website can mine users' consumption or browsing records, establish users' consumption preference model, and recommend excellent products to targeted customers with appropriate recommendation technology, thus reducing consumers' time and energy in searching for their real favorite products. Multi-dimensional dynamic recommendation system of mobile e-commerce platform using an improved collaborative filtering algorithm updates the weights of user feature vectors and commodity feature vectors according to the real-time changes of user behavior, and improves the dynamic updating ability of the recommendation system, so as to improve the accuracy of recommendation and the satisfaction of users.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>GRAINRec: Graph and Attention Integrated Approach for Real-Time Session-Based Item Recommendations</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recent advancements in session-based recommendation models using deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant performance improvements. While they can enhance model sophistication and improve the relevance of recommendations, they also make it challenging to implement a scalable real-time solution. To addressing this challenge, we propose GRAINRec- a Graph and Attention Integrated session-based recommendation model that generates recommendations in real-time. Our scope of work is item recommendations in online retail where a session is defined as an ordered sequence of digital guest actions, such as page views or adds to cart. The proposed model generates recommendations by considering the importance of all items in the session together, letting us predict relevant recommendations dynamically as the session evolves. We also propose a heuristic approach to implement real-time inferencing that meets Target platform's service level agreement (SLA). The proposed architecture lets us predict relevant recommendations dynamically as the session evolves, rather than relying on pre-computed recommendations for each item. Evaluation results of the proposed model show an average improvement of 1.5% across all offline evaluation metrics. A/B tests done over a 2 week duration showed an increase of 10% in click through rate and 9% increase in attributable demand. Extensive ablation studies are also done to understand our model performance for different parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>To increase the sales of agricultural products in e-commerce, understanding customer preferences is essential. In agricultural web applications, data mining techniques can help farmers analyze customer behavior patterns and identify preferences, thus optimizing product design or offering more precise personalized services, which, in turn, can enhance farmers' decision-making in agricultural production. This study proposes a web application user behavior prediction method based on deep forest, which addresses the issue of traditional learning methods requiring a large number of hyperparameter settings. Analysis results show that the Mondrian deep forest model has an accuracy of 95.42% and a running time of 55 s. The accuracy and efficiency of the Mondrian deep forest model are higher than for other models, and the proposed model can improve the accuracy of predicting user behavior in web applications. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been validated through practical testing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Blockchain For Transactive Energy Marketplace</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The term “energy prosumer” refers to a new job category that has emerged with the advent of distributed energy production via residential and commercial photovoltaic (PV) applications. The conventional distinction between energy providers and consumers becomes muddled as a result. For the procedure to be automated, blockchain technology has been used. This will make it easier for consumers, prosumers, and utilities to deal directly with energy safely, conveniently, and cost-effectively. This research aims to provide an agent-based modeling (ABM) simulation framework for energy exchange, exhibiting the anticipated power profiles of families and illustrating the operation of blockchain operations (see Figure. 1). A distributed energy resource (DER) of the transactive energy (TE) type was simulated inside the Education City Community Housing (ECCH) microgrid using a reliable multi-agent framework. Blockchain technology is necessary for this. Current blockchain-based local energy market (LEM) plans depend on precise short-term energy generation forecasts and home consumption to balance supply and demand. The present research evaluated the precision of cutting-edge energy forecasting methods in estimating homes’ energy production and consumption. It examined the effects of forecasting mistakes on market results under various supply scenarios. While LSTM models may provide few forecasting errors, the researchers discovered that the prediction process must be changed for a LEM constructed on a blockchain. Since this study tries to predict the timeline of smart meters generally, it sets itself apart from past investigations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Integrated Machine Learning Concept with XG Booster and Random Forest Framework for Predicting Purchase Behaviour by Online Customers in e-Commerce Social Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce - electronic commerce has been used by various companies in recent years to communicate and retain clients or customers. Different marketing strategies, such as digital promotion and online advertising, have been used and integrated with E-commerce systems. Normally, the advertiser will post the affiliated links to redirect the customers to the merchant. In the e-commerce business, lack of transparency in exhibiting the products and providing trust among the consumers in the e-commerce spaces are doubtful. In this research, a hybrid model with the integration of XGBoost and Random Forest classifier has been utilized to predict the current and previous behaviors of the consumers in order to identify the final action of whether the consumer will buy the product or not. This process mainly alleviates data overload issues and offers better-personalized services to targeted online consumers in various applications. The performance has been evaluated on certain metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1 measure, and AUC score. Eventually, the proposed hybrid model results were compared with the existing methods based on accuracy and procured 91.1%, which is effective compared to other existing algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Promoting Sustainable Business Operations and Autonomy</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This empirical study examines the ways artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally changing sectors around the globe, with a particular emphasis on the way AI is revolutionizing autonomous and sustainable business practices. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) with sustainability cannot be considered accidental; rather, it is a calculated reaction to the urgent need to solve environmental issues, improve productivity, and promote innovation. Fundamentally, sustainability aims to strike a balance between the environmental, social, and economic ramifications of corporate operations. Artificial intelligence (AI) is essential to establishing this balance because of its capacity to analyse enormous data volumes, extract insightful knowledge, and make deft judgments in real time. It gives organizations the ability to simultaneously enhance the standard of living for people and communities while decreasing their environmental impact, maximize resource use, and negotiate the challenges of a fast-paced global marketplace. The literature review in the research emphasizes the way artificial intelligence (AI) maximizes resource utilization, minimizes waste, and aids in environmental conservation and monitoring. It emphasizes the manner in which artificial intelligence (AI) may improve waste reduction, energy efficiency, and accurate agriculture, including autonomous procedures. Robotic process automation and predictive analytics systems powered by AI are prime examples of the operational autonomy attained in business. AI, sustainability, and autonomy work together to generate a potent blend that promotes eco-friendly behaviour and increases productivity. It makes the deployment of Internet of Things technology, smart cities, and circular economy models easier. The study recognizes difficulties and moral issues, which include data privacy and employment displacement, despite the enormous promise.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on the Model of Agricultural Product Purchase Intention Based on Live Broadcast AI and Recommendation Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes a model of agricultural product purchase intention based on live broadcast AI and recommendation algorithm (LiveRec). By combining AI behavior analysis in live broadcast with traditional recommendation algorithm, this model can adjust the recommendation strategy in real time according to the user's viewing behavior, interaction, comments and other information, thereby improving the user's purchase intention. This paper makes use of the live broadcast data from the e-commerce platform of agricultural products, including user behavior data and sales records, to evaluate the effectiveness of the model in the forecast of buying intention and the exchange rate. Experiments show that the precision of the prediction is increased by 18 %, and the conversion ratio is 15 % higher than that of conventional logistic regression and SVM. In particular, the model has good adaptability and real time performance in the user's personalized recommendation. The study indicates that the model based on live AI and recommended algorithm can increase the sales efficiency of agriculture products, and it will have a bright future. Future research will further optimize the model's real time performance and processing efficiency, and extend its application to other electronic commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unification of Billing and Employee Management through Integrated E-Commerce for Enhanced Pharmacy Services</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The present research endeavors to introduce a groundbreaking web application, which serves as a unified billing management system specifically designed for pharmacies. The current state of pharmacy management systems is characterized by a fragmented approach, where separate software solutions are utilized for employee management and e-commerce functionalities. This fragmented approach has led to various inefficiencies and a subsequent rise in operational costs. One significant constraint of existing systems is found within the arduous process of managing inventory. The proposed solution aims to mitigate the issue by incorporating an advanced search capability that encompasses various filters. This feature enables the swift identification of medicines, thereby ensuring the precise fulfillment of prescriptions. The present system has been meticulously developed with the primary objective of identifying expired pharmaceutical products. This innovative feature serves to bolster the overall safety of medication by effectively thwarting the inadvertent inclusion of expired medicines in customer orders. Moreover, the web application integrates sophisticated deep-learning techniques for the purpose of inventory management, facilitating the option of either manual data entry or image-based identification. In summary, the present study introduces a transformative solution for the management of pharmacies, effectively tackling the drawbacks associated with fragmented software systems.

        <dc:title>Blockchain-Enabled Energy Marketplace</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The growth of decentralized energy production, especially through solar PV systems in homes and businesses, has introduced the concept of an “energy prosumer.” This term combines the roles of energy producers and consumers, challenging traditional categorizations. The key factor in this transformation is blockchain technology. By utilizing its encrypted database structure built on consensus, blockchain provides a novel solution for direct energy trading. It serves a wide range of users, including everyday consumers and prosumers, as well as larger energy suppliers and utility companies, ensuring secure and cost-effective energy transactions. This research aims to introduce and apply an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that simulates electricity trade. The goal is to predict household power consumption patterns and validate blockchain procedures. A specially designed multi-agent system, specifically created for Transactive Energy (TE) in Distributed Energy Resources (DER), was developed and tested within the ECCH microgrid, relying on blockchain principles. Emerging concepts like blockchain-driven Local Energy Markets (LEM) suggest the use of auction mechanisms to balance future energy supply and demand. These models require accurate short-term predictions of individual household energy generation and usage. This study focuses on improving the accuracy of household energy forecasts using advanced techniques. It also examines the impact of prediction errors across three different supply scenarios. This research significantly diverges from previous studies that mainly tracked smart meter timelines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Feature importance in predicting customer offer acceptance in online retail</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Accurately predicting whether customers will accept offers is essential for improving marketing strategies and increasing engagement in the highly competitive online retail sector. This study applies predictive modeling and key feature analysis to a dataset of 2,198 customers, each characterized by 20 features, including demographics, spending patterns, and engagement metrics. Techniques such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression were employed to predict offer acceptance, with performance evaluated through five metrics including confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These approaches achieved high accuracies of 99.32%, 98.86%, and 98.41%, respectively, indicating strong predictive reliability. Among the various features, customer income emerged as the most significant predictor of offer acceptance across all models, emphasizing the importance of financial metrics in understanding customer behavior and preferences. These findings underscore the value of financial insights, providing data-driven guidance for marketing strategies to enhance engagement, optimize conversion rates, and boost sales in online retail.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Personality-Aware Product Recommendation System Based on User Interests Mining and Metapath Discovery</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A recommendation system is an integral part of any modern online shopping or social network platform. The product recommendation system as a typical example of the legacy recommendation systems suffers from two major drawbacks: recommendation redundancy and unpredictability concerning new items (cold start). These limitations take place because the legacy recommendation systems rely only on the user's previous buying behavior to recommend new items. Incorporating the user's social features, such as personality traits and topical interest, might help alleviate the cold start and remove recommendation redundancy. Therefore, in this article, we propose Meta-Interest, a personality-aware product recommendation system based on user interest mining and metapath discovery. Meta-Interest predicts the user's interest and the items associated with these interests, even if the user's history does not contain these items or similar ones. This is done by analyzing the user's topical interests and, eventually, recommending the items associated with the user's interest. The proposed system is personality-aware from two aspects; it incorporates the user's personality traits to predict his/her topics of interest and to match the user's personality facets with the associated items. The proposed system was compared against recent recommendation methods, such as deep-learning-based recommendation system and session-based recommendation systems. Experimental results show that the proposed method can increase the precision and recall of the recommendation system, especially in cold-start settings.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Model Based on Ensemble Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The sales trends and the visitors' purchase intention of e-commerce are crucial issues for companies. Therefore, companies want to know whether products are purchased based on customer visits. This study proposes an ensemble learning-based model to analyze customers' purchase intentions for e-commerce companies. It is possible to create a more accurate model using several machine learning methods within a system, which is the ensemble learning approach. The prediction performance of the proposed model is evaluated by different metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, and F-score. This paper aims to improve the purchasing rates of online shopping sites by determining the rate of visitors who intend to purchase but leave the site without taking action by using information such as the click flow of visitors.</dcterms:abstract>

Intuitively, the visual information available on e-commerce platforms can effectively function as a primary source for certain product attributes. However, existing works either extract attribute values solely from textual product descriptions or leverage limited visual information (e.g., image features or optical character recognition tokens) to assist extraction, without mining the fine-grained visual cues linked with the products effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel task - Multimodal Joint Slot Filling (MuJo-SF) - that aims to combine multimodal information from both product descriptions and their corresponding product images to jointly fill values into the pre-defined product attribute set. To this end, we develop MAVP, a new dataset with 79 k instances of product description-image pairs. Specifically, we present a strategy to fulfill visualized saliency ascription, which aims to distinguish between text-dependent and image-dependent attributes. For those image-dependent attributes, we annotate the corresponding values from images using distant supervision. Then, we design a model for MuJo-SF, which combines multimodal representations and fills image-dependent and text-dependent attributes separately. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on MAVP and provide rich results for MuJo-SF, which can be used as baselines to facilitate future research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Machine Learning Model for Sentimental Analysis of Amazon Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The goal of this project is to draw a deeper understanding of the subjective nature behind online product reviews, largely by examining a large dataset received from Amazon that contains numerous star ratings and comments. Since there is such a massive amount of data on the Amazon platform, it was perfect for the analysis. Our methodology is platform-agnostic and can be easily extended to other comparable datasets from other web platforms with comparable guarantees in achieving wide applicability. Our primary motivation is improving the dependability of online shopping. Since product reviews are currently widely used by many consumers as guides in making decisions to buy products, such reviews ought to be fair representations of the actual dependability and quality of the products. The goal of our effort is to identify patterns in the language and ratings of such reviews that would directly reflect the real customer sentiment and also the reliability of the product. Our approach has yielded already a rate of about 92%, which shows it has the potential greatly to raise the legitimacy of online reviews. We'd like to make our customers feel more confident and better equipped with information to make better and safer purchases on a website like Amazon and others. In the final analysis, we strive to make online shopping for our customers worldwide safer and more trustworthy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendation Algorithm based on Relative Features</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Ratings and reviews on e-commerce platforms often contain a lot of useful information. In recent years, researchers aim to mine more information from ratings and reviews to improve recommendation performance. However, researchers have not fully considered the effect of mining the relationship between comments on feature representation. On the basis of previous research, this paper proposes a deep recommendation model based on relative features. We mine the relative attention between comments, calculate the relative features of users and products based on the attention, and use the relative features to complete recommendation. Experiments show that the effect of the model proposed in this paper is better than the previous models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>DigiFresh - Quality Assurance of High Value Foods</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Quality assurance of high value foods is essential for online food suppliers and retailers to enhance customer experience and avoid returns and refunds. Blind spots in transport value chain due to absence of real-time monitoring of quality, online suppliers face huge economic loss and wastage of high value foods like dairy, fruits, vegetables, fish and meat due to return or door-step refusal by the customers. Technology has evolved to address these blind spots and prevent such wastage and economic loss while ensuring brand value. Online suppliers can now give quality assurance to the customers at the doorstep. Our solution leverages IOT technologies, multimodal sensing and data science to address this concern by estimation of food quality in real-time and predicting remaining shelf life at doorstep thus assuring the customer of the freshness of the purchased foods such as dairy, fish meat etc.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Ensemble based Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Customer Churn in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Due to the intense competition among E-Commerce industries, customers have a large selection of products to choose from and as a result, these industries experience customer churn. Since retaining existing customers than acquiring new ones is cost effective, customer churn prediction is key for the E-commerce industry. The goal of this paper is to forecast customer churn for a ride sharing application by training appropriate supervised ensemble-based machine learning models including Gradient Boost, Cat Boost and XG Boost on a known dataset containing 50,000 known samples of many such customer attributes as well as their loyalty to the application. A variety of manual preprocessing approaches, such as removing missing data, duplicate data, outliers, etc., were employed to reduce the high-class imbalance in the raw dataset while also preventing useful information loss in the already small dataset, enabling the models to predict customer churn with neutrality. Standardization techniques was also utilized to normalize the data so as to restrict the wide distribution of each feature and improve model performance. The AUC-ROC performance metric was used, which met our objectives while also working well with imbalanced datasets. Gradient Boost and Cat boost algorithms performed the best in identifying potential churning customers, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.85 and computation times of 58 seconds and 80 seconds respectively, while XG boost was not far behind with an AUC-ROC score of 0.84 and the fastest computation time of 45 seconds among all models assessed.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Collab Vivasayi: Enhancing Agricultural Livelihoods Through Online Marketplaces and Consumer-Direct Relationships</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>More than half of the population still relies on farming as their main source of income, yet only a small fraction of farmers manage to make profits. This issue arises from excessive dependence on intermediaries and brokers, who control prices, resulting in minimal earnings for farmers and inflated costs for consumers. To tackle these issues, Vivasayi introduced an innovative app designed to create direct connections between farmers and consumers, eliminate middlemen, and promote a fairer marketplace. The application, which was built using Flutter, boasts an intuitive and visually pleasing interface. Firebase serves as the backend framework to ensure robust security, whereas machine-learning algorithms enhance the platform by examining user behavior and product quality to offer personalized, intelligent recommendations. Vivasayi sought to transform the agricultural industry by harnessing advanced technology and encouraging direct farmer-consumer interactions. This platform aims to empower farmers with improved financial returns, enhance market efficiency, and build trust among stakeholders, ultimately leading to a sustainable and thriving agricultural ecosystem.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Smart Features, Smarter Insights: The Role of Feature Engineering in Customer Purchase Predictions in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Accurately predicting customer purchase intent is vital for achieving success in the e-commerce environment. While machine learning provides advanced solutions, the effectiveness of predictive models largely depends on the quality of the selected features. This study explores the impact of three feature selection methods—Information Gain, Chi-Square, and Fisher Discriminant Ratio—by utilizing real-world clickstream data to predict purchasing behavior. Our analysis reveals that the choice of selection method significantly affects the identification of key features. In particular, the Chi-Square method proved to be the most effective in minimizing class overlap, allowing for clearer differentiation between sessions that ended in a purchase and those that did not. Additionally, features associated with historical purchase probability and temporal attributes consistently demonstrated high discriminatory power. This study underscores the importance of effective feature engineering as a fundamental strategy for generating insightful predictions and enhancing model performance in understanding online consumer behavior.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Graph-Based User-Centric Recommender System Using Neo4j, Cypher, and Jaccard Similarity in the Field of e-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a scalable and interpretable recommender system architecture that uses a property graph model implemented in Neo4j to generate personalized product recommendations. By representing customers and products as nodes and purchases as edges, and leveraging Jaccard similarity over shared purchases, the proposed system identifies nearest neighbors and recommends items accordingly. The use of graph queries allows for explainability, flexibility and improved performance compared to traditional collaborative filtering methods. Visualization with networkx further enhances transparency. Our research contributes a novel integration of graph-based storage, similarity computation and visual analytics in the domain of recommender systems. We further propose an algorithm for building a graph-based recommendation system for e-commerce to offer personalized suggestions. It is implemented by batching relationships and using the UNWIND clause in Cypher to minimize memory and network overhead. Experimental results transaction data show that the graph-based method delivers interactive performance and high-quality recommendations, which are validated by comparing Jaccard similarity scores with results from the Surprise recommendation library.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Price Suggestion for Online Second-hand Items</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper describes an intelligent price suggestion system for online second-hand listings. In contrast to conventional pricing strategies which are employed to a large number of identical products, or to non-identical but similar products such as homes on Airbnb, the proposed system provides price suggestions for online second-hand items which are non-identical and fall into numerous different categories. Moreover, simplifying the item listing process for users is taken into consideration when designing the price suggestion system. Specifically, we design a truncate loss to train a vision-based price suggestion module which mainly takes some vision-based features as input to first classify whether an uploaded item image is qualified for price suggestion, and then offer price suggestions for items with qualified images. For the items with unqualified images, we encourage users to input some text descriptions of the items, and with the text descriptions, we design a multimodal item retrieval module to offer price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.</dcterms:abstract>

According to the application, a prediction model based on the radial basis function (RBF) is established to predict the actual network data flow. Simulation experiments show that, compared with the prediction of BP neural network, the prediction method of RBF neural network based on chaos theory has fast learning speed and high prediction accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Comments and Feedback Verification System using Large Language Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, the rapid expansion of digital platforms has resulted in a substantial rise in user-generated content, especially comments and feedback. For increasing traffic on website and selling products people uses fake reviews. Verifying the authenticity and relevance of this content is essential for preserving the integrity of online communities and enhancing user experience. This paper introduces an innovative system for verifying comments and feedback using large language models (LLMs). The proposed system employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and pretrained LLM models to analyze and verify the content of user comments and feedback. This advance feedback verifier system helps to figure out either comments are real or fake for e-commerce websites. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed system in various real-world situations, demonstrating its potential to greatly enhance content moderation processes and promote healthier online interactions. This system can also understand personalized recommendations about any product and it could be a great step towards making purchasing decision.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Virtual Restaurant Platform Based on AI</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Restaurants are progressively utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to alleviate and resolve the persistent challenges of protracted wait times, manufacturing errors, supply chain complications, and labor shortages. Although the standard understanding of artificial intelligence in restaurants sets up images of kitchens staffed by machines that have been instructed, this does not accurately represent the technology's actuality. The most common ways in which artificial intelligence is impacting restaurant operations are by reducing the number of errors caused by humans, managing increasing expenses, improving production accuracy, adhering to safety regulations, and redefining the customer experience within the restaurant. Restaurant owners and administrators can take advantage from artificial intelligence procedures that are designed to enhance capacity, enhance forecasting precision, and expedite production while concurrently stimulating development. Additionally, devices that are equipped with virtual assistants and artificial intelligence may be assigned the responsibility of effectively managing client conversations, reservations, and suggestions, in addition to providing customized ordering. This paper offers a comprehensive examination of the methods that have been employed to integrate AI into virtual restaurant platforms, and is dedicated to the development of an intelligent customer order management platform that efficiently streamlines the order process by utilizing AI technology. The paper illustrates the proposed virtual restaurant platform that is based on AI, and explains its distinct features and functions. The proposed virtual restaurant platform is designed with the objective of enhancing the customer ordering experience, enabling customers to personalize their chosen meals, and enhancing the operational efficiency of restaurants.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Inverse Document Frequency &amp; KNN Machine Learning Approach based Novel Text Semantic Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the modern era each and every thing is digital. E- commerce takes the place of the physical market. People buy anything not going physically anywhere and they are used the E-commerce platform. When The people buy, initially read the reviews provided by the previous customer regarding the product and decide they buy or not. So, the reviews are most essential part of the customer as well as for the customer. This paper delineates the sentiment analysis (SEAN) of the cell amazon real data values initially, use the NLTK, Porter Stemmer and various processing for pre-process the data and get the clean and desired data. Secondly, use the term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) method for extracting the feature and divide the data using the train and test split and last apply the K-nearest neighbor method to train the machine. The artificial model predicts the positive and negative reviews. The experiment outcome result shows the model accuracy, precision, recall of the novel developed algorithm on the real text set.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recency-Frequency-Monetary Analysis and Recommendation System using Apriori Algorithm on E-Commerce Sales Data</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The Recommendation Systems and Operation Analysis at Amazon.com account for a significant portion, specifically 35%, of the company’s revenue. By providing product recommendations during online shopping, these systems play a crucial role in increasing the average order value, click-through rates, and email conversions. This is achieved through intelligent predictions that anticipate what items customers are likely to purchase next. With the help of big data and data mining, this research focuses on building an online product recommendation engine which predicts products a customer is most likely to buy based on the customer’s shopping history as well as browsing data. In this paper, we aim to discuss recent research and practical applications related to RFM, Association Rule, Apriori Algorithm, and Streamlit. Our goal is to build a full stack recommendation engine using Python, Streamlit, Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) Analysis, and the Association Rule (Apriori Algorithm).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Prediction Model of User Purchase Behavior Based on Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, with the continuous popularity of the Internet, the number of online shopping users in my country has reached 639 million, which contains huge commercial value. In order to maintain the prosperity, diversity and order of merchants, and fully meet consumers' one-stop shopping needs, it is necessary to analyze and predict user purchase behaviors more accurately. This article uses the interaction between users and products within a certain period of time provided by JD.com to predict whether users will place orders in designated categories and shops in the next week. First of all, we aim at the problem that the original features are not strongly related, and use feature fusion to construct strong features. For high-dimensional systems that are slow to calculate and prone to overfitting, we use random forests to filter features, reducing the complexity of the model. Finally, a fusion algorithm based on XGBoost and LightGBM is proposed to predict the purchase behavior of users, and the prediction effects of random forest and GBDT algorithm are compared at the same time. The results show that the fusion model has the best prediction effect, and can help merchants more accurately conduct marketing activities to potential customers based on the prediction results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Hybrid Model for Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data in Dari-Persian Text</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this modern world of social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and applications, humongous amounts of user-generated content and comments are created as individuals share opinions on products and services and engage in discussions around political and social issues. Notwithstanding the growing importance of sentiment analysis for decision-making in marketing, public policy, and social analysis, available annotated corpora for Persian, and especially its Dari dialect, remain scarce. In addition to that, feature engineering techniques are crucial to getting a more profound understanding of the context. To address this gap, we propose an ensemble sentiment classification model adapted specifically to Persian text. Our method uses three different types of recurrent models, GRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM, each focusing on different parts of the sequence to understand the text better. For word embeddings, pre-trained FastText vectors were trained on a large Persian text corpus, ensuring that the small differences in dialects were included. During prediction, we combine the results from the three submodels using a weighted voting method, which takes advantage of their unique strengths for better decision-making. The proposed model achieved 94.21% and 96.69% SentiDariPers and DeepSentiPers accuracy. These results outperform state-of-the-art methods and are reliable regardless of sentence length or topic.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Product Review Authenticity Detection with Ensemble Learning and BERT Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study explores the integration of TF-IDF, count vectorization, and the BERT model within the context of fake review detection. TF-IDF and count vectorization, renowned for their ability to capture linguistic nuances, are employed as feature extraction techniques to encode the distinguishing characteristics of genuine and deceptive reviews. Through rigorous experimentation, we evaluate the efficacy of these methods in enhancing the discriminatory power of fake review detection systems. Our findings demonstrate that the fusion of TF-IDF, count vectorization, and the BERT model yields a formidable framework capable of discerning subtle linguistic cues indicative of fraudulent content. Leveraging the complementary strengths of these techniques, our approach offers both interpretability and scalability, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in fake review detection. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to fortify the integrity of online information ecosystems and uphold trust and credibility in digital discourse.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Graph Data Science Application in Omni-Channel</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In today's competitive retail environment, omni-channel e-commerce has become a critical strategy for delivering seamless customer experiences across diverse touchpoints such as websites, mobile apps, physical stores, and social media platforms. The complex relationships and interactions between customers, products, and channels present significant analytical challenges. Graph Data Science (GDS) offers a powerful framework to model and analyze these relationships, providing actionable insights to optimize customer engagement, detect fraud, and streamline supply chains. By representing entities such as customers and products as nodes, and their interactions as edges, GDS enables the use of advanced algorithms for community detection, link prediction, and anomaly detection. This paper explores the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for tasks such as customer segmentation, personalized recommendations, and cross-channel journey optimization. Through real-world applications, the paper emphasizes how GDS transforms large-scale, unstructured e-commerce data into actionable insights, driving business growth and enhancing operational efficiency. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of GDS as an essential tool for retailers navigating the complexities of omni-channel commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Mining Association Rules for Optimizing Customer Purchase Behavior in E-Commerce Transactions</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In a bid to improve e-commerce transactions and effective business strategies, it is important to understand customer purchase behavior. We introduced an integrated approach in this paper which was utilized to mine associate rules to optimize customer purchase behavior. Clustering algorithms (K-Means and DBSCAN) are used on the transactional data to clean the data by removing noise and dealing with missing values, which increases the quality of the data. The researchers analyze the frequent itemsets and association rules for co-occurrence, lift, and confidence measures using the Apriori, FP-Growth algorithms, AprioriDP, Eclat and RFrequent. Furthermore, classification models like Decision Tree and Random Forest are implemented for evaluation purposes and performance comparison. From the experimental results, the accuracy with decision tree was observed to be 72.54%, while random forest yields an accuracy of 77.48% with effective precision, recall and F1 score metrics. The paper also engages in comparative studies with recent studies to show the effectiveness of our method. These findings enable actionable insights for enhancing product suggestions and tailored marketing tactics in e-commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multi-Task Learning with Calibrated Mixture of Insightful Experts</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Multi-task learning has been established as an important machine learning framework for leveraging shared knowledge among multiple different but related tasks, with the generalization performance of models enhanced. As a promising learning paradigm, multi-task learning has been widely adopted by various real-world applications, such as recommendation systems. Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE), a well-received multi-task learning method in industry, based on the classic and inspiring Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure, explicitly models task relationships and learns task-specific functionalities, generating significant improvements. However, in our applications, negative transfer, which confuses considerable existing multi-task learning methods, is still observed to happen to MMoE. In this paper, an in-depth empirical investigation into negative transfer is launched. And it reveals that, incompetent experts, which play fundamental roles under the learning framework of MoE, are the key technique bottleneck. To tackle this dilemma, we propose the Calibrated Mixture of Insightful Experts (CMoIE), with three novel modules (Conflict Resolution, Expert Communication, and Mixture Calibration), customed for multi-task learning. Hence a group of insightful experts are constructed with enhanced diversity, communication and specialization. To validate the proposed method CMoIE, experiments are conducted on three public datasets and one real-world click-through-rate prediction dataset we construct based on traffic logs collected from a large-scale online product recommendation system. Our approach yields best performance across all of these benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of it.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Improvising E-Commerce Sentiment Analysis with Hybrid VADER-BERT Ensemble Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With substantial growth in the e-commerce market, the product reviews have taken the key role to support customers in the decision making process. User feedback may contribute to customers making not only the effective decisions but also help the business community to improve in multiple dimensions. Correct sentiment analysis is an important factor in managing product quality. Customers rely on reviews to gauge others' opinions about products. However, existing sentiment analysis models face several challenges. These include difficulties in capturing the complexity and context of language, leading to reduced accuracy. The multimodality of reviews data and the potential imbalanced datasets pose various challenges, consequently resulting in biased classification. This paper proposes a hybrid model combining BERT, SMOTE, and VADER to address these challenges. BERT provides a deep understanding of local and global dependencies in text, SMOTE generates synthetic data to address class imbalance, and VADER provides labels for fine tuning BERT. With our real dataset, the proposed ensemble model achieved 98.1% accuracy with other satisfactory performance measures.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Item Category-Oriented User Behavior Path Analysis in CTR Prediction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In E-commerce, Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models are often intended for analyzing user behavior patterns, identifying potential user interests, and therefore estimating purchasing intent. Existing models often incorporate various types of interactions between users and items/products (referred to as multi-type user behavior) to address the issue of data sparsity caused by relying on a single type of behavior. While this method introduces more user behavior features, it also brings some irrelevant noise into the prediction model—information not directly related to the predicted item. To address this, we introduce the concept of the Item Category-oriented User behavior Path, or ICUP, which consist of behaviors such as clicks, add-to-cart actions, and favorites, all focused on items within the same category. These behavior paths not only reflect the user’s potential interest in the target category of items but also implicitly indicate the user’s thought processes and decision-making throughout the purchasing process. We employ an adaptive mechanism for depicting the unique characteristics of user behavior preferences. Finally, a contrastive learning mechanism is integrated into the feature representation of behavior paths, enhancing the accuracy of the feature representation. We conducted a series of experiments on the publicly available Taobao dataset, and the results verify that our CTR prediction method yields desirable improvements in AUC and accuracy compared to baseline models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Ensemble Learning Model for Prediction of Natural Gas Spot Price Based on Least Squares Boosting Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Among fossil fuels, natural gas has been considered a fuel of choice for increasing the supply of energy and reducing environmental contamination worldwide. Given that the supply chain of natural gas is characterized by imbalances between demand and supply on a timely basis, effective and fast models for accurate spot price prediction for natural gas would not only inform but also help various stakeholders to make wise decisions in the competitive natural gas marketplace. Proposed in this paper is a regression ensemble learning model based on least squares boosting algorithm for improving the prediction of natural gas spot price on a monthly basis. Ensemble learning models are becoming more preferred predictive tools due to their capability to train multiple weak learning models, and aggregate their outputs to produce a strong learning model with better overall accuracy. A broad scope of time series data from January 1997 to May 2020 from Henry Hub natural gas spot prices were employed in developing and testing the proposed model. Coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are employed as performance metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Compared to four existing state-of-the-art approaches, overall results show that the proposed model exhibits better performance over the state-of-the-art methods with R2, MSE and RMSE scores of 0.9668, 0.3248, and 0.5699, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Discover Customers’ Gender From Online Shopping Behavior</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Gender information is very important for the recommendation system in the online shopping website. However, gender data often face label missing and incorrect labelling problems caused by consumers’ unwillingness to actively disclose personal information, which leads to gender estimation results that cannot meet the needs of the product recommendation system. To discover the customers’ gender information, we explore the customers’ online shopping behavior, especially the items viewed in the shopping session, from the dataset provided by Vietnam FPT Group. The dataset is very imbalanced while the number of female samples is 3\times of the male samples. To address the imbalance issue, we cluster the female samples into three subsets and then train a two-layer classifier model to estimate the customers’ gender. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve a combined accuracy 78% on average, and takes less than 6 seconds on average. As a data mining model for gender prediction, our approach has a lightweight network structure and less time consumption.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Reducing Packaging Waste in E-commerce through IoT and SVM-Based Predictive Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Packaging waste has increased significantly due to the explosive growth of online shopping, a major environmental problem. With Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based prediction models and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, this paper investigates ways to reduce online shopping package waste. The proposed solution tracks and analyses packaging operations, looking for wasteful practices and ways to reduce them, using sensors that are IoT-enabled and real-time data analytics. Training SVM-based models on past data allows for the prediction of ideal packaging techniques that minimize waste without compromising product safety. The experimental findings show that our method can reduce packaging material consumption by 30%, which indicates that IoT and machine learning can promote sustainable e-commerce practices. Contributing to worldwide efforts to reduce waste and advance the area of sustainable logistics, this paper offers a solid foundation for online retailers to use greener packing practices. The model shows that the IoT and SVM are beneficial in sustainable e-commerce logistics, reducing packaging waste by 32%, shipping costs by 18%, and improving package quality by 25%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Prediction of Student Satisfaction on Online Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic - A Case Study on Sri Lankan Universities</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the sudden upsurge of the Corona Virus (COVID -19) epidemic, higher education institutions around the globe have been engaging in untiring efforts to provide continuous learning opportunities for the students and to safeguard their welfare. This research is done to investigate the true experiences of university students in Sri Lanka using e-learning facilities throughout this period of the epidemic situation and forecast the adaption of e-learning in the universities after this epidemic situation. For this purpose, an online survey was designed and a formal questionnaire was circulated. In the end, after a thorough survey, a satisfactory result was obtained. Out of the 909 responses, 189 were not interested in involving in the e-learning process in the future whereas 460 were identified as satisfied with the adaption of e-learning. In addition, the rest of the 260 was satisfied with both the cases. Furthermore, the dataset fed into selected supervised machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to develop the prediction model on forecasting the likelihood of students with the adaption of the method of e-learning in the days to come. As per the results obtained, ANN outperformed against SVM and resulted in an accuracy of 76.19%. Immense inconveniences were experienced in the course of the students’ academic activities, because of the sudden upsurge of the pandemic. They are namely inaccessibility of technological devices, poor connectivity of the internet, and unsuitable surroundings for learning. This attempt also pinpoints the characteristics of the prevailing technological procedures in the making of distance learning theory. It was concluded that additional funding and feasible plans would be necessitated for the enhancement of an effective teaching-learning process towards the aforesaid method of the educational framework all over the country.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Natural Language Processing-Based Product Category Classification Model for E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In scope of the great dynamism that the world of e-commerce gained with the post-pandemic changes on customer behavior, extending the customer’s time on site has become much more valuable. With regards to creating a better understanding of the online shopper’s intent on site, an effective search engine is the best tool for improving the user experience. A useful search engine needs to produce fast results and do intent analysis of customers correctly to present successful recommendations. In this study, BERT, ELECTRA and RoBERTa which are language models that give successful results in similar problems and pre-training libraries in Turkish languages are used for developing text classification and customer intent analysis models based on e-commerce product categories. The results of these deep learning models, which were optimized using the product description and comment libraries of the selected e-commerce brand, are shared in a comparative way, and the results of our e-commerce end-user intent analysis model, which was tested on user search history, were detailed on the basis of product category. The developed model can be used for e-commerce product prioritization in Turkish language, as well as creating an infrastructure for the development of intent analysis models that are able to predict as far as the main product that the user wants to display in searches containing multiple products.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Intelligent Location-Based Recommendation System for Enhancing Shopping Experience</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The challenge of meeting the changing preferences of retail customers through personalized shopping experiences has become difficult due to the lack of data in offline stores. The proposed approach uses intelligent location-based recommendation systems powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve the entire customer purchasing process. Using smart shopping carts equipped with tags and time-tracking capabilities, the proposed system monitors and analyzes the behavior of customers across the store. This data is then integrated with customer profiles to uncover valuable insights, including purchasing patterns, preferences, and correlations. Using decision trees, collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a rule mining algorithm, the proposed system optimizes inventory management and store layout and provides personalized product recommendations. Through these techniques, retailers can effectively personalize the shopping experience and ultimately increase sales and customer satisfaction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Exploring Opinionated Sentiments through Web Scraping and Attribute-based Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The majority of customers consult online reviews before choosing which e-commerce services or products to buy. The new aspect of the suggested strategy is the use of opinion mining on customer reviews to assist businesses and organizations in continuously improving their marketing strategies and acquiring a thorough analysis of consumer impressions of their goods and brands. This study employed deep learning convolutional neural networks coupled with convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) to analyze the sentiment of reviews inside the ecommerce business. The algorithm’s performance on previous iterations of the website was assessed using a web archive to predict how well the algorithm might function in the future. When the words around the pertinent data are categorized under the presumption that the website’s future HTML would seem similar to the current HTML, robust scraping is possible. The algorithm generates a variety of outcomes based on a wide range of factors that can be discovered both in the website’s internal code and in prior versions of the websites. The confusion matrix indicates how well the classification algorithm is executed. In simple terms, we obtained an accuracy of 80.12%. The model performed good job prediction for both classes with high precision and recall scores.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Fake Review Identification Using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The use of false opinions, sometimes known as fake reviews, to mislead customers has become more common in recent times. This is due to the fast growth of online marketing initiatives such as purchasing and selling. Customers can leave comments and evaluations regarding the goods or services they have purchased when they shop online. Prior to making a purchase, prospective buyers typically read the reviews and comments that have been left on the website. The present difficulty, meanwhile, is getting newcomers to discern genuine evaluations from fraudulent ones, which go on to deceive consumers, create losses, and harm the image of companies. This research objective is to create a trained model that can point out fraudulent feedback on e-commerce sites by utilizing sentiment ratings and n-grams of the review text provided by the reviewer. When the outcomes were compared to previous studies that employed the same dataset, proposed methods performed better in terms of accuracy than the equivalent approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper discusses the optimization problem of e-commerce logistics networks, which mainly includes four issues: 1) establishing a model for predicting the volume of goods on each route; 2) calculating and distributing the volume of goods on the DC5-related routes to achieve load balancing on each route; 3) optimizing the logistics network structure to achieve load balancing on each route while reducing the number of routes with significant changes in transportation volume; 4) evaluating the importance of logistics sites and routes, proposing improvement plans, including the construction of new logistics sites and routes, and considering the robustness of the network. For issue 1, the paper predicts the volume of goods on each route and presents specific predictions for each route. For issue 2, linear programming or integer programming models are used to allocate the volume of goods on DC5-related routes, calculating the number of routes affected by changes in transportation volume due to the closure of DC5 and the network load. For issue 3, the allocation plan is optimized, and the number of routes affected by changes in transportation volume due to the closure of DC9 and the network load is calculated, providing the quantity, volume of goods, and load during normal and abnormal flow, and calculating the increase or decrease in the number of routes on a daily basis. For issue 4, the importance of logistics sites and routes is evaluated, improvement plans are proposed, including the construction of new logistics sites and routes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>12 Dyna-SPECTS: DYNAmic enSemble of Price Elasticity Computation models using Thompson Sampling in e-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This work introduces Dyna-SPECTS, a novel dynamic ensemble-based Thompson sampling model for calculating price elasticity (PE) in the e-commerce sector, focusing on kids’ clothing. The model uniquely amalgamates four distinct Thompson sampling based algorithms namely - algorithms - distribution approximation, XGBoost regressor, GAN, and MCMC sampling - to determine PE distribution parameters. Dyna-SPECTS’s outstanding feature is its dynamic ensemble mechanism, which adeptly selects optimal PE values from a suite of strategies like minimum, maximum, average, weighted MAPE, and linear regressor, guided by cumulative rewards. This approach adapts to variable market conditions in the constantly evolving e-commerce landscape, including competitor pricing, seasonal changes, and customer segmentation. Empirical tests across diverse datasets have confirmed Dyna-SPECTS’s exceptional performance, showcasing substantial improvements in sales and margins, especially for SKUs experiencing PE fluctuations. The model also demonstrates efficacy in using transfer learning for PE computation, yielding a 7% margin improvement and a remarkable 35.3% reduction in RMSE for demand forecasts. Innovations in Cross-PE coefficient integration and price personalization have led to further margin enhancements. Moreover, the model excels in omnichannel pricing, achieving a 17.5% margin increase. Long-tailed product pricing using these PE values showed an increase in sales volume and revenue compared to traditional pricing strategies. Dyna-SPECTS prioritizes scalability using parallelization, distributed computing, and optimizing algorithms, efficiently managing a high volume of SKUs without compromising computational effectiveness and achieving rapid convergence. It represents a significant leap in dynamic price elasticity computation, offering a scalable, versatile, and empirically proven solution for e-commerce pricing challenges.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Leveraging Sentiment Analysis and Negation Phrase Identification for Mitigating Information Overload in E-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the era of e-commerce, online reviews have become crucial for both consumers and merchants. However, the overwhelming volume of reviews has resulted in Information Overload (10). To address this, we employ Sentiment Analysis (SA) on user comments, utilizing machine learning to classify sentiments. Our study focuses on the challenge of accurately predicting sentiment orientation, particularly noting that adjectives and adverbs with negative prefixes can convey opposite sentiments. We introduce a negation phrase identification algorithm to address this issue. By combining sentiment analysis and negation phrase identification, our research aims to alleviate information overload, providing valuable insights for e-commerce stakeholders. Our model, utilizing the Bayes classifier, achieves an 89% accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of machine learning in understanding customer sentiment. The research findings indicate that employing machine learning algorithms, particularly the Bayes algorithm, on textual data will allow businesses to gain valuable insights into customer sentiment, surpassing the limitations of manual efforts. The combined approach positions the sentiment analysis methodology as a forefront contender in natural language understanding, promising more reliable and contextually accurate assessments of sentiment from user-generated text data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>6 Retailing and e-commerce riding on technology: augmented reality and virtual reality</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Today’s world and economy are driven by technology and technology-savvy people across all sectors. Moreover, since industrial revolutions have a long-term impact on businesses and society, it is also associated with the progression and recognition of new technologies. Therefore, emerging technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will have immense potential worldwide in the dynamic retail and e-commerce industry. This chapter gives the reader an idea about the use of AR and VR in the e-commerce and retail sectors. The retail industry has grown considerably over the last two decades with the advent of e-commerce. It is no longer just a “purchasing” activity-based industry. Instead, it has become an “interactive” industry that provides customers with a “shopping experience.” Very soon, AR and VR could be critical factors in establishing customer engagement and product promotion. The Indian retail business is close to $1 trillion in size. It is undergoing various noteworthy changes, including premiumization, a movement toward freshness, a resurgence of vintage habits, increased customer trust on the internet, and a need for 10 min delivery. Some were secular developments, while the Covid-19 tailwind helped others. As a result, the old-world order of organized retail, the value of location and scale, and the power of shelf space are all up for grabs. Some upcoming advances (supported by tech innovations) are virtual reality, augmented reality, robots, facial recognition, 3D printing, etc. They are making their presence felt. These show that they are gradually being accepted. They provide retailers with new ways to engage with their customers and retain them. They are also managing their stores more efficiently while reducing costs, where possible. As a result, retail has become more transformative. Some of the changes are: - Use of AR/VR - Social commerce - Giving importance to deploying machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) - Video commerce - Digitization of distribution - Hyperlocal commerce - Omni-channel retailing Other enabling technologies include dynamic demand forecasting and computer vision to understand buyer behavior in store. Objective This chapter gives the reader an idea about the use of AR and VR in the e-commerce and retail sectors. The following topics are covered in this chapter: - AR/VR: understanding the terms - AR/VR: advantages and disadvantages - The changing nature of the e-commerce and retail industry (across the globe and in India) - AR/VR: benefits to e-commerce and retail industry - Factors responsible for the limited use - A few practical examples (in the e-commerce and retail industry).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multi-Agent Personalized Recommendation System in E-Commerce based on User</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As more sectors began to switch from conventional business models to e-commerce in response to the general trend toward mobile Internet use, the scale of e-commerce grew rapidly. There are three types of recommendation systems: hybrid, collaborative, content-based. Content based systems take into consideration the characteristics of the recommended objects. Then, titles in the database that have been classified as “romantic” are selected using a content-based recommendation method. Collaborative filtering systems utilize similarity measures to recommend items that are shared by individuals or objects with similar interests. Users are recommended items based on their preferences. In the recommendation system, collaborative filtering is the most popular and effective suggestion process. However, system performance impact as the amount of time required to locate the target user's closest neighbor across the entire user space increases with the number of users and products in the e-commerce system. The applied and designed Multi-Agent personalized recommendation system in E-commerce can be analyzed using user clustering in the Multi-Agent to E-commerce personalized recommendation system. An implementation strategy for recommendations based on user clustering is shown in this analysis. According to their scores for commodity categories, users are clustered, and only the nearest neighbours in their categories are searched, so that as many nearest neighbors as possible can be searched. The accuracy, recall, and specificity of this analysis are used to calculate its performance. In this analysis the presented method will give better results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Detecting Account Takeover (ATO) in Fintech Companies Using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Financial technology usually called fintech, has changed the landscape of financial services by introducing technological innovations to simplify, digitize, and disrupt traditional services. However, because of these technological developments, account takeover (ATO) attacks are one of the new challenges that have appeared, threatening user security and platform reputation. Account Takeover (ATO) attacks cause a significant risk for many sectors, including financial services, online retail, and social media. However, most current efforts focus more on Sybil detection and fraud detection rather than ATO. ATO attacks cause significant harm to users and fintech companies, including identity loss and loss of customer trust. This study compares the effectiveness of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Light GBM in finding new fraud trends. This is achieved by applying Machine Learning (ML) methods to improve credit card fraud detection. This dataset contains 6,362,620 unbalanced data that are balanced using the undersampling technique. Among the four algorithms compared, the LightGBM algorithm achieves the best result with an accuracy of 0.99. These results enable fairly accurate fraud detection. This research contributes to fintech companies by advancing the understanding of ML techniques in fraud detection, providing a comparative analysis of different algorithms, and providing more effective strategies for solving credit card fraud problems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Shopee Price Match Guarantee Algorithm based on multimodal learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Shopee has been a popular online shopping website in the Southeast Asia. Customers appreciate its easy, secure, and fast online shopping experience tailored to their region. At the same time, it allows customers to choose the one with the lower price of the same product. It relies on the product matching, that is the same product with the same description image must be removed. The base technology to achieve this function is multimodal learning, in which we focus on the images and text. In our article, we proposed a new multimodal learning model mainly based on transformer and BERT. For image matching, we use NFNet, Swin_Transformer and Efficientnet to get image embeddings. For text matching, we use Distil-Bert, Albert, Multilingual Bert and TF-IDF to get text embeddings. After we get the embedding vector, we choose KNN to classify. We use cosine and distance to measure the similarity of the different models. It is worth mentioning that the loss function is Arcface, not the traditional Softmax, which improve the difficulty of training to ensure the final performance in the test periods. In addition, 7 models vote for the final results ensuring the effect of prediction. To avoid the bad matching result, we add some postprocessing process.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Negotiation Closer Bot: Negotiation Outcome Predictor based on Sentiment Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>On e-commerce platforms like OLX, Craigslist, etc. users can sell and buy a variety of products and also chat with the buyer for additional information such as pictures, description and more importantly for negotiating the prices. This process of negotiation is tedious for all users and some simply do not know how to negotiate. To tackle this, a system that assists negotiations for the user would solve the problem. Therefore, we have created a web application platform that allows users to list products to buy and sell products with an added feature of a negotiation support system that assists users in the negotiation process by predicting whether the negotiation is going to end in success or failure. Users can trigger it whenever they deem it necessary by clicking on the ‘Get Recommendation’ button. This system will read the chat using functions of Natural Language Processing Toolkit (NLTK) library followed by classification using classifier. After testing four classifiers namely, Naïve Bayes, Descisioon Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest, we selected SVM as it gave the highest accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Design and Implementation of a Web-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Credit card fraud detection is a key problem in various industries, including banking, e-commerce, and healthcare, where detecting fraudulent activity in a timely manner is crucial. This research project describes a unique method for developing a credit card fraud detection system using a deep learning algorithm, an Autoencoder (AE). The system includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with a Streamlit web application framework that allows users to input data and obtain real-time fraud detection. The developed system uses the Autoencoder (AE) architecture, which can learn complicated hierarchical data representations. The model is trained using valid transaction data to capture the underlying patterns and properties of authentic transactions. When the model meets data that deviates considerably from its learned representations, anomalies, indicating probable fraudulent actions, are recognized. Multiple assessment criteria were used to analyze the system's efficacy, including precision, recall, confusion matrix analysis, model reconstruction error, accuracy, and F1 score. The precision assesses the proportion of accurately recognized fraud cases among all anticipated fraud instances, whereas recall assesses the actual fraud cases found. The confusion matrix analysis offers a detailed picture of the model's performance across various prediction outcomes. The developed credit card fraud detection system was created and trained with Google Collab, a cloud-based platform that provided the computing resources needed for the Autoencoder (AE) model training. The combination of the GUI-based user input system and the Autoencoder (AE) model allows users to engage with the fraud detection system naturally, allowing for real-time detection of possible fraud threats. The reconstruction error of the model is an important measure of its capacity to help discriminate between regular and fraudulent cases. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.92, demonstrating the system's ability to predict both non- fraudulent and fraudulent online credit card transactions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Hypergraph-Enhanced Contrastively Regularized Transformer for Multi-Behavior E-commerce Product Recommendation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Multi-behavior sequential recommendation systems, which predict users' subsequent interactions based on historical behavior sequences, play a vital role in e-commerce operations. Despite the promising results of existing state-of-the-art methods, which employ either advanced attention mechanisms or graph-based neural networks, they still face a few open challenges, including the diversity of user actions, the intricate relationships within time-evolving interactions, and the complications introduced by limited or noisy data. To address these limitations, we propose a Similarity Graph-enhanced Multi-Scale Transformer (SG-MST) for multi-behavior e-commerce product recommendation. SG-MST integrates a Similarity Augmented Multi-Behavior Hypergraph that captures complex behavior-aware dependencies among items and strengthens connections through item context similarities, producing more informative latent representations. Additionally, we introduce a Contrastively Regularized Multi-Scale Transformer, which leverages contrastive learning to capture enriched sequential patterns across both long-term and short-term dynamically sampled and augmented temporal scales, thereby improving the robustness of user behavior prediction. Extensive evaluation on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed SG-MST outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Integration of AI, IoT and Edge-Computing for Smart Microgrid Energy Management</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Towards zero CO2 emissions society, large shares of renewable energy sources and storage systems are integrated into microgrids as part of the electrical grids for energy exchange aiming to effectively reduce the stress from the transmission grid. However, energy management within and across microgrids is complicated due to many uncertainties such as imprecise knowledge on energy production and demand, which makes energy optimization challenging. In this paper, we present an open architecture that uses machine learning algorithms at the edge to predict energy consumption and production for energy management in smart microgrids. Such predictions are aggregated across different prosumers at a centralized marketplace in the Cloud using Kafka Streams and OpenSource IoT platforms. Using pluggable optimization algorithms, different microgrids can implement different strategies for real-time optimal energy schedules. The proposed architecture is evaluated in terms of scalability and accuracy of predictions. Our heuristics can effectively optimize medium-sized microgrids.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Zipf Matrix Factorization: Matrix Factorization with Matthew Effect Reduction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender system recommends interesting items to users based on users' past information history. Researchers have been paying attention to improvement of algorithmic performance such as MAE and precision@K. Major techniques such as matrix factorization and learning to rank are optimized based on such evaluation metrics. However, the intrinsic Matthew Effect problem poses great threat to the fairness of the recommender system, and the unfairness problem cannot be resolved by optimization of traditional metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that incorporates Matthew Effect reduction with the matrix factorization framework. We demonstrate that our approach can boost the fairness of the algorithm and enhances performance evaluated by traditional metrics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Adaptive and Efficient Streaming Time Series Forecasting with Lambda Architecture and Spark</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the streaming platform has tremendously increased the data in motion or streaming data. It incorporates a wide variety of data, for example, social media posts, online gamers in-game activities, mobile or web application logs, online e-commerce transactions, financial trading, or geospatial services. Accurate and efficient forecasting based on real-time data is a critical part of the operation in areas like energy &amp; utility consumption, healthcare, industrial production, supply chain, weather forecasting, financial trading, agriculture, etc. Statistical time series forecasting methods like Autoregression (AR), Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Vector Autoregression (VAR), face the challenge of concept drift in the streaming data, i.e., the properties of the stream may change over time. Another challenge is the efficiency of the system to update the Machine Learning (ML) models which are based on these algorithms to tackle the concept drift. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle both of these challenges. The challenge of adaptability is addressed by applying the Lambda architecture to forecast future state based on three approaches simultaneously: batch (historic) data-based prediction, streaming (real-time) data-based prediction, and hybrid prediction by combining the first two. To address the challenge of efficiency, we implement a distributed VAR algorithm on top of the Apache Spark big data platform. To evaluate our framework, we conducted experiments on streaming time series forecasting with four types of data sets of experiments: data without drift (no drift), data with gradual drift, data with abrupt drift and data with mixed drift. The experiments show the differences of our three forecasting approaches in terms of accuracy and adaptability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting the Intention of Online Shoppers’ Purchasing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays the pace of modern life makes people have less time to go shopping. With the development of technology, more and more people choose to purchase things online. For merchants, the competition in electronic business is becoming fierce. Among all of e-commerce platforms, it is clear that who know their customers more can seize the initiative the market. So, this paper tends to have an interest in coming up with a tool that may analyze the factors in several aspects that build individuals a lot of doubtless to get product. During this paper, we recommend a period of time on-line shopper behavior prediction system that predicts the visitor’s looking intent as before long because the web site is visited. To do that, session and visitant data is applied to investigate random forest. What is more, oversampling is used to enhance the performance and therefore the quantifiability of every classifier. The results show that random forest produces considerably high accuracy 86.78% and F1 Score 0.6.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Personalized Email Marketing: A Machine Learning Approach for Higher Engagement and Conversion Rates</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This research analyzes machine learning to aid in increase of purchase rates of product-promo-code pairings in digital marketing. We evaluate the effectiveness of these pairings using four machine learning models: These include Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light GBM). After the comparison of classification report and kappa statistics, Light GBM was identified as a model that yields the highest accuracy rate of 86% and the kappa score of 0. 71. Thus, this research investigates the impact of machine learning in addressing marketing optimization problems and enhancing the conversion. Altogether, the findings confirmed the relevance of data analysis for increasing the efficiency of marketing strategies and offered practical recommendations for companies interested in improving the purchase rates with proper combinations of products and codes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Food Reviews using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Amazon food reviews refers to the feedback given by the users or customers who have purchased a certain food item from the Amazon platform. There are more than 500,000 reviews which help us to analyze and improve the current sentiment of the customers using the amazon products they have purchased and used. Here we have used 7 classifiers on the given dataset on Amazon fine food reviews from Kaggle. Our experiment results showed that we have the highest accuracy when using Logistic Regression and SGD with 94.342% with TFIDF and BOW respectively. Other classifiers also come close to this accuracy using BOW and TFIDF in our research. We have also used BERT and GloVe and LSTM for further analysis. All this is done by dividing the dataset into positive and negative reviews. Taking a scale of 5 to rate the given products we can identify if the customer likes their used products or not.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multi-Modal Self-Supervised Learning Algorithm-Based Product Recommendation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rise of e-commerce, personalized recommendation algorithms have received much attention in recent years. Meanwhile, multimodal recommendation algorithms have become the next competitive track of personalized recommendation. The current mainstream recommendation algorithms (e.g., NeuMF, NGCF) rely too much on empirical data and do not effectively utilize multimodal information to model user preferences, while there is the problem of sparsity of user preference data. Secondly, they are still limited to using the same weights to fuse the item features of different modalities, and have the problem of inaccurate recommendation. For this reason, this paper proposes Multi-Modal Self-Supervised Learning Algorithm Based Product Recommendation (MMSLRec). 1) Data augmentation by self-supervised adversarial perturbation generation learning is performed to supplement the missing interaction information of tailed products to solve the common data sparsity problem in product recommendation. 2) A multimodal representation learning module is introduced to capture deep features in image and text modalities using AlexNet and Bert, respectively, in order to avoid the recommendation accuracy degradation problem caused by insufficient data feature learning. 3) Learning the user’s perceived strength in different modalities, using the user co-occurrence matrix to fuse the features and make recommendations. Experiments on Amazon-Electronics, Amazon-Clothing, and Amazon-Baby, with different degrees of data sparsity verify the effectiveness of our MMSLRec in solving the data sparsity problem and the multimodal user preference modeling problem, and compared to the state-of-the-art baseline recommendation model on the three datasets, the Recall@20 improved by 9.26%, 3.11% and 2.92%, respectively. Note to Practitioners—The motivation for this article arises from the requirement of efficient recommendation algorithms for e-commerce platforms. Mainstream recommendation algorithms are mainly based on sparse user item history interaction data for recommendation, which receives the limitation of data sparsity problem to a larger extent. Secondly, it is still limited to using the same weights to fuse the features of different modalities in the multimodal recommendation process. In this paper, we propose MMSLRec, which solves the data sparsity problem to a certain extent by using adversarial generative networks and fuse the features from different users using the user co-occurrence matrix. This method achieves better results in different applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Stacking Ensemble of Multi Layer Perceptrons to Predict Online Shoppers' Purchasing Intention</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of the internet, the field of E-Commerce has seen tremendous growth. The easy accessibility of viewing and purchasing products, and having it delivered to your doorstep is what makes E-Commerce extremely successful. E-Commerce also caters to almost every possible field, ranging from electronics to fashion to groceries. The number of visitors on E-Commerce websites is growing at a rapid pace, but the number of purchases remains constant. A novel stacking ensemble system has been proposed, which makes use of Multi-Layer Perceptron's to detect the intention of a user on whether a product would be purchased or not. ‘Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention’ Dataset has been used. The proposed stacking ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 94% in predicting whether a user will purchase a product or not, based on the session details. To evaluate the proposed system, it is compared to over 15 classification algorithms, as well as existing systems that make use of the dataset. The results obtained show that the proposed stacking classifier outperforms the various classification algorithms as well as existing systems that make use of the dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for a Distributed Energy Marketplace in Smart Grids</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based energy market for a prosumer dominated microgrid. The proposed market model facilitates a real-time and demand-dependent dynamic pricing environment, which reduces grid costs and improves the economic benefits for prosumers. Furthermore, this market model enables the grid operator to leverage prosumers' storage capacity as a dispatchable asset for grid support applications. Simulation results based on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework demonstrate significant improvements of the 24-hour accumulative profit for both prosumers and the grid operator, as well as major reductions in grid reserve power utilization.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A study of cargo volume prediction and personnel scheduling based on random forest and greedy algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper investigates the problem of cargo volume prediction and scheduling planning for sorting centers in the context of e-commerce. Firstly, through the preprocessing and analysis of the cargo volume data, it is found that the cargo volume shows a periodic distribution over time, which provides a basis for the subsequent model construction. Then, a random forest regression model was adopted for cargo volume prediction, and the model was trained and predicted through the steps of data import, preprocessing, extraction transformation and standardization. Finally, a scheduling planning model was established, which was solved by greedy algorithm and linear programming respectively, providing an optimization scheme for the scheduling of the sorting center. In the future, the greedy algorithm can be combined with other optimization algorithms to further improve the effect of scheduling planning. Meanwhile, more influencing factors, such as employee skills and equipment conditions, can be introduced to make the cargo volume prediction more accurate. In addition, the model can be considered to be extended to other fields, such as warehouse management, logistics and distribution, etc., in order to realize a wider range of applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Warehouse Efficiency With Time Series Clustering: A Hybrid Storage Location Assignment Strategy</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the rapidly evolving domain of e-commerce, effective warehouse management emerges as a critical factor for ensuring timely deliveries. This paper addresses the Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP) in e-commerce warehouses, a challenge intensified by varying product volumes and unpredictable demands. We introduce a novel Intelligent Storage Location Assignment (ISLA) method that utilizes advanced time series clustering algorithms specifically, Self-Organizing maps, dynamic time warping-Based k-means, and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), to optimize order fulfillment and enhance warehouse efficiency. By clustering and positioning items with similar demand patterns, our approach minimizes order preparation time, reduces unnecessary warehouse movements, and improves operational flows. Our empirical evaluation, based on a real-world dataset from Kaggle, demonstrates the superiority of AHC in efficiently grouping high-turnover items, as evidenced by higher silhouette scores. Applying this method in simulations across various picking strategies such as s-shape, mid-point, discrete order picking, zone picking, and batch picking, we achieve significant efficiency improvements. Notably, our ISLA method results in up to 61% and 69% efficiency gains under s-shape and midpoint routing policies, respectively, outperforming traditional random and ABC storage assignments. These results not only highlight the significant potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing warehouse operations but also bridge the existing knowledge gap by showcasing a practical and impactful application of AI in SLAP. Our research advances the field of smart logistics, emphasizing the critical role of AI-driven intelligent storage location assignment in optimizing warehouse processes and enhancing the efficiency of the e-commerce supply chain.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Temporal Insights for Group-Based Fraud Detection on e-Commerce Platforms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Along with the rapid technological and commercial innovation on e-commerce platforms, an increasing number of frauds cause great harm to these platforms. Many frauds are conducted by organized groups of fraudsters for higher efficiency and lower costs, also known as group-based frauds. Despite the high concealment and strong destructiveness of group-based fraud, no existing research can thoroughly exploit the information within the transaction networks of e-commerce platforms for group-based fraud detection. In this work, we analyze and summarize the characteristics of group-based frauds. Based on this, we propose a novel end-to-end semi-supervised Group-based Fraud Detection Network (GFDN) to support such fraud detection in real-world applications. In addition, we introduce a module named Temporal Group Dynamics Analyzer (TGDA) that strengthens the ability to analyze temporal information on group fraudulent activity. Based on this, we built an enhanced model named TGFDN. Experimental results on large-scale e-commerce datasets from Taobao and Bitcoin trading datasets show our proposed model's superior effectiveness and efficiency for group-based fraud detection on bipartite graphs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Milk Grade Detection and Analysis of Quality Factors for Dairy Farm Management</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Milk is a very important drink that is required by individuals of all the ages. Milk is the source of various vitamins and minerals for our body as well as a good source of protein. However, it is equally important to make good quality of milk to be available to the consumer. Milk produced in dairies often carry various disease causing germs due to improper care of the cattle. So, milk quality check is performed. However it is not possible for a human being to go through the large volume of numerical data. So we have to design an intelligent system that is capable of scanning through large volumes of the milk data and extract the parameters. It must also be able to predict with very high accuracy the presence of any kind of anomalies or substances that can harm the quality of the milk that is sold and at the same time help in the E-commerce aspect by farming management with milk testing labs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Design and Development of CULTIMAX Framework for Crop Selection and Trading Optimization Towards Agriculture Sustainability</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture stands as the primary revenue source for many developing nations, necessitating the adoption of modern farming techniques to meet evolving demands. However, farmers encounter various challenges in navigating this transition. Climate change, induced by soil erosion and industrial emissions, poses significant hurdles, alongside soil nutrient deficiencies like nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus, which can hinder crop health, along with the pitfalls of monoculture farming. Innovative approaches are required to address these issues and enhance agricultural sustainability and productivity in developing economies. This paper presents “Cultimax,” a web application for smart farming and online agricultural trading, enhancing crop selection based on weather and soil nutrients. By fostering direct farmer-to-customer communication via an e-commerce platform, the aim is to boost farmers' profits. The app offers farmers a user-friendly interface for marketing, market insights, and scheme updates, with online payment options. Addressing current e-commerce limitations, it provides automated crop predictions and fertilizer recommendations using machine learning. Light Gradient Boosting Machine has shown the best accuracy for crop prediction and fertilizer recommendation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Analytical Perspective to Comprehend Customers Shopping Online</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid development of the internet and online platforms has transformed our daily lives. More and more companies have shifted their business models to the digital platform, especially in the retail sector. In recent years, online shopping in Malaysia exhibited a positive trend because of increase in the usage of smartphones and also due to the affordability of consumers. Consumer behavior is crucial for online shopping companies to understand purchasing patterns and this is achievable through developing predictive models. In this competitive business world, path analysis is immensely used by marketers to understand consumer behavior through website navigation. Business intelligence transforms the raw data into meaningful information for greater productivity. Churn analysis is part of business intelligence that investigates customer behavior to understand the reason for churn. This study provides a comprehensive overview of consumer intention and behavior toward the e-commerce sector by investigating various machine learning models such as association analysis, and sequence analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>User Evaluation Sentiment Analysis Model Based on Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In order to obtain a correlation between the online evaluation of three online sales products provided by Amazon and their corresponding star rating, we use the tf-idf algorithm for text mining on three online product evaluations, extract each product based on the AFINN sentiment dictionary of sentiment words with tf-idf values included in consumer reviews, and add their intersections into a thesaurus. We also extract the brand information implied in the information and observe a certain difference in the consumer evaluation of each brand. Based on our established thesaurus, we conduct a sentiment analysis of consumer text reviews, assign corresponding sentiment scores, and obtain the corresponding review score variables. Then, we find a significant correlation between the consumer sentiment score and its corresponding star rating. Based on the star rating, verified purchase, and helpful votes variables in the data, we use machine learning models to learn the sample characteristics of each star rating. The final three-product decision tree model has an accuracy of 78.33%. The accuracy rate of the 5-star evaluation is 99.41%, which can better distinguish the extreme evaluations of consumers to a certain extent. An evaluation model based on product brand, consumer star rating, and market share of product brand is established to predict the potential success or failure of the product to a certain extent.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Study on Recommender Systems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summary In today's world, where we have an abundance of data collected over the years, Machine Learning aims to put this data to use. This data can be used to train machines to accurately predict the behavioral patterns of users, thus making many processes automated. This project explores one such specimen being implemented in the field of e‐commerce today: Recommender system. As shopping moves from the physical to the online world, providing products to customers according to personal preferences becomes a bigger challenge. Recommender systems are the solution to this problem. Most recommender systems in practice today use complex characteristics to improve performance and results. However, in this exposition, we explored a simpler approach to recommender systems that are fairly easy to use for small scale e‐retail websites. Further, we tried and tested small variations in the data set and compared their performances, therefore, obtaining the best performing algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Malicious Click Identification and Prediction Method Based on Optimized RF</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To address the issue of malicious clicks affecting the accuracy of recommendation systems in e-commerce platforms, this study investigates the identification and classification algorithms for malicious click behavior. The research processes and selects features of the data through the SMOTE and the recursive feature elimination algorithm, and conducts model predictions based on the logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest algorithms respectively. Through multiple evaluation indicators, the performance of the models is comprehensively assessed. The experiments show that among the three traditional models, the random forest model performs the best. On this basis, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the random forest model, and the results indicate that the optimized model has improved classification performance for the minority class. Finally, based on the actual scenarios of ecommerce platforms, relevant suggestions are provided from the aspects of optimizing recommendation systems and improving platform management strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Understanding the Impacts of Top-Tier Streamer De-Emphasizing in Live Streaming E-Commerce: A Social Evolution Game Perspective</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Live-streaming e-commerce has achieved significant growth by combining live interactive broadcasts with online shopping, with platform revenues largely depending on a small number of top-tier streamers. However, this dependence grants these top-tier streamers excessive bargaining power and makes platforms vulnerable to their negative impacts. To address this issue, this study aims to provide strategy recommendations for live-streaming e-commerce platform managers to reduce reliance on top-tier streamers. We achieve this goal by constructing a social evolutionary game model (SEGINE). This model utilizes real-world data from Chinese social media and live-streaming e-commerce platforms to simulate the diffusion process of live-streamed product information within social networks and analyzes the impact of different “de-emphasize top-tier streamers” strategies on information dissemination. By integrating the characteristics of live-streaming platforms and social networks, we consider the effects of indirect network externalities on evolutionary game dynamics, thereby providing a basis for platform managers to formulate relevant decisions. The experimental results show that appropriately limiting the influence of top-tier streamers may help build a healthier and more sustainable live-streaming e-commerce ecosystem. The novelty of this study lies in its first-time application of a social evolutionary game model to analyze the interaction between live-streaming e-commerce platforms and social networks, and to explore the potential impacts of strategies that de-emphasize top-tier streamers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Probabilistic Model for Predicting E-commerce Purchases from Emerging Local and Social Interests</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting future user purchase in e-commerce is an interesting problem and is potentially beneficial for both marketing and user experience. Previous studies show that user online behaviors such as browsing and clicking contain predictive hints for future purchases. In contrasts to previous works, in this paper, we consider purchase as a part of an emerging process. We aim to predict purchases with emerging local and social interests that can be associated with purchases temporally. The local interests are extracted from user clicking data provided by a data marketing company, and the social interests can be extracted from social media platforms such as Twitter. We also follow a Bayesian approach to model three parameters to represent user, website, and social influence, in relation to purchase, and calculate posterior of model parameters with proper assumptions of priors. We conduct experiments to test the effectiveness of our approach with real-world e-commerce purchase datasets, and the results show that our model has clear predictiveness for future purchases. More specifically, we show that in some cases, our model increases prediction precision by 21% compared to the case where no prediction effort is made.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>SST: Semantic and Structural Transformers for Hierarchy-aware Language Models in E-commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Hierarchies are common structures used to organize data, such as e-commerce hierarchies associated with product data. With these product hierarchies, we aim to learn hierarchy-aware product text embeddings to improve fine-tuning performance on a variety of downstream e-commerce tasks. Existing methods leverage hierarchies by either aligning the text embeddings to separate hierarchical embeddings or by aligning the hierarchical information implicitly within a unified text Transformer. Although these models optimize to predict hierarchy information, performing further fine-tuning on new tasks is non-trivial. To bridge this gap, we propose a pre-training architecture to implicitly encode the hierarchy within the product text and then directly leverage a sub-set of the pre-training model during fine-tuning. Pre-training is done through Semantic and Structural Transformers (SST) where the Semantic-Transformer first encodes the product text into a contextual embedding, which is then used by the Structural-Transformer to infer the product’s path in the hierarchy. Fine-tuning is done using only the initial Semantic-Transformer, now that hierarchy-aware text embeddings are learned. With this design, we eliminate the need of linking each fine-tuning dataset with corresponding hierarchies. This leads to fine-tuning performance improvements on critical e-commerce downstream tasks over the existing state-of-the-art hierarchy models, even when hierarchy data is available during fine-tuning. Moreover, this improvement is consistent even after augmenting our baseline models to support fine-tuning. We conclude by discussing how such implicit structural encodings can be leveraged beyond the e-commerce domain.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Collaborative Recommendation of E-commerce Products Based on Data Mining of Consumer Purchasing Behavior Characteristics</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of network economy, using e-commerce platform to establish the relationship between enterprises and consumers and enhance trust has become an important goal of enterprise management. By mining the distributed information power of consumer behavior, combining the community trust and preference similarity of user relations, we can find the nearest neighbor of the target user, predict consumer purchase behavior. Apply SMOTE-ENN method to solve the uncertainty problem to ensure the accuracy of product recommendation. The improved algorithm is compared with random forest algorithm, XG boost algorithm and light GBM algorithm. The results show that the estimation performance of random memory model is the best among the three models, and the accuracy and memory of test results exceed 0.85%. It is the second and only model of LightGBM, but there are differences in predictable performance. The practice shows that the improved recommendation algorithm has obvious advantages in accuracy, recall and F-index system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>EI Integrated PR for Online Communication in Customer Loyalty: The Mediating Role of Artificial Intelligence</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Emotional Intelligence, when integrated into Public Relations, adds potential value to retail sector organizations. However, with the rise of ICT, these factors are further enriched by Artificial Intelligence as the organizations are more goal-oriented, adopting certain customer-centric approaches. This study also focused on the role of the Emotionally Intelligent Public Relation system in the United Arab Emirates benefiting from Artificial Intelligence integration. The primary focus remained on Artificial Intelligence, upgrading these Public Relations practices and improving customer loyalty. The researchers used a self-proposed conceptual model assessed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results revealed that Public Relations practices are significantly affecting Social Skills (p&gt;. 020) and Empathy (.000) as primary components of Emotional Intelligence (EI). Besides, the effect of Social Skills on Empathy also remained significant (p&gt; 045). On the other hand, Social Skills (p&gt;. 000) have a significant effect on Customer Loyalty, which is significantly mediated by Artificial Intelligence (p&gt;. 070). Thus, it is concluded that when Public Relations integrated with Emotional Intelligence are linked with Artificial Intelligence, positive, constructive outcomes are ensured. Particularly, in the retail sector, organizations integrating Artificial Intelligence provide the service as best matching the customers, adding more value to the services and product quality of the certain retailer, indicating the same patterns of consumer experiences leading to loyalty among them.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Role of Consumer IoT Smart Devices for Safety and Security of Data Privacy to Enhance User Experience of E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid advancement of Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) smart devices has significantly transformed the electronic-commerce (e-commerce) setting by enhancing user experiences through personalized, efficient, and intuitive interactions. In this article, we propose a new Dynamic Adam driven-Analytic Long Short-Term Memory (DA-ALSTM) to analyze how CIoT devices can influence and monitor customer interactions and personalization in e-commerce through real-time data collection. Min-Max Normalization is employed in all the CIoT data attributes to convert comparable scale, and then the extracting key behavioral components in the scaled data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the predictive DA-ALSTM model is used in CIoT smart devices using TensorFlow, ALSTM can predict future user preferences, recommend customized product recommendations, and improve user experience. The proposed method’s better performance in traditional approaches such as evaluated matrices are accuracy (95.6%), precision (93.15%), user satisfaction (92.6%), response time (150 ms), and MSE (1.2). The result demonstrates the DA-ALSTM effectively forecasts user preferences improves e-commerce personalization and enhances product recommendation accuracy and user experience in the CIoT smart devices then accurately predicts e-commerce platform performance are most significantly influenced by purchase history, browsing behavior, CIoT device interaction data, product reviews and ratings, search queries, digital marketing engagement, device and platform preferences, discounts response, offers, and price sensitivity, time of interaction, loyalty, and membership status, user feedback and satisfaction scores.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Generating Realistic Users Using Generative Adversarial Network With Recommendation-Based Embedding</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>User data has been used by many companies to understand user behaviors and finding new business strategies. However, common techniques cannot be used when it comes to new products that have not yet been released due to the fact that there are no prior data available. In this work, we propose a framework for generating realistic user data on new products which can then be analyzed for insights. Our model uses Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) with the Straight-Through Gumbel estimator which can also handle discrete-valued outputs. The CGAN is conditioned on product features learned using a recommendation system which can better capture the relationship between products. Experiments using a dataset consisting of view logs from a real estate listing website shows that our model outperforms other baselines on four performance metrics, and can effectively predict the finer characteristics of new products.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Analysis of the Relevance between Title of Product and Search Term</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, the product recommendation algorithm of e-commerce platforms has become more and more important. In this paper, we built a Random Forest Regression model for the problem of predicting the correlation of “search term” and “product title We found this model for the dataset by describing and attributing the products. In the process of numerically calculating features, we applied two types of feature engineering. The first method is to describe and attribute the numbers to the number of words or the length of the sentence. The second method is to use string similarity characteristics to calculate the distance between “search term” and “product title On the results, we got a similar histogram of the correlation scores between the training dataset and the results from the test dataset. The RMSE of the relevance between the training dataset and the predicted value is 0.3179 which indicates that the model is working well.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-commerce Product Review Analysis based on Multi-class Support Vector Machine</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recently, an extensive number of consumers can choose their best options from automated retailers and compare products in online stores. Sentiment analysis is frequently employed in applications meant to demonstrate and provide client service as the voice of the user. On E-commerce websites, user reviews provide helpful information about the product. Sentiment analysis of the text reviews helps forecast product sales by assessing user sentiment regarding the product. The Word Embedding Attention approach assigns additional weight to words that have a strong association with a specific class. Sentiment analysis machine learning models provide a thorough depiction of capabilities and far surpass conventional feature-based methods. The obj ective of this research is to improve sentiment analysis performance by creating a weighted ensemble with a Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) model utilising novel word embedding techniques. Because of the weighted ensemble's higher generalisation skills, MSVM produces superior results. When comparing existing methods for sentiment analysis, the Weighted ensemble with MSVM has produced higher results in terms of accuracy, precision, f-score, and recall. The Weighted ensemble with an MSVM has achieved 99.87 % accuracy, 99.39% precision, 99.03% f-score, and 99.690/0 recall in sentiment analysis when comparing existing methods such as LSTM+FL, APSO-LSTM, ABCDM, SSentiA, and Hybrid CNN+LSTM.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>C2M E-commerce Service Quality Evaluation Based on LDA-BiLSTM Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the context of digital economy, the C2M model, as a new e-commerce model to meet customers’ personalized needs, provides more efficient, convenient and personalized services. In order to explore the evaluation of C2M e-commerce service quality, a C2M e-commerce service quality evaluation model based on LDA theme model and BiLSTM model is proposed. Deep learning has powerful feature selection and feature extraction capabilities, which can automatically capture more abstract and comprehensive semantic information of text, combine topic mining with emotion analysis, and help to identify the needs of users. The LDA theme model is used to extract 8 C2M e-commerce service quality themes; analyzing the service quality themes extracted by LDA based on BiLSTM model, the accuracy, recall rate and F1 factor of Bi-LSTM model are above 90%, indicating that it can accurately predict the emotional tendency of the text, and further select the themes with more negative comments. According to the emotion analysis results, consumers have high negative emotional tendency of commodity cost performance, quality control, personalized customization and logistics service, which are 0.28,0.26,0.25 and 0.21 respectively. Analyanalyze the causes of negative emotions, and put forward targeted suggestions to improve the service quality of C2M e-commerce. The method of this paper makes the C2M e-commerce comment text more expressive, which helps the C2M e-commerce company to better understand the needs of customers and improve the service quality.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Reducing Delivery Time in E-Commerce Orders With Advanced Ant Colony Hybridization by GRU Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The efficiency of the supply chain is highly corelated with the acceleration of preparing orders from the warehouse to meet customer requests on time. A unified framework optimising the movement of item pickers throughout the warehouse aisles and shelves via reducing their motion route length during orders collected. The framework consists of three stages. The preamble stage aims to sort the items according to XYZ/ABC pattern “assignment policy”. The 2nd stage classifies the customers’ orders according to route similarity via hybridising the (Extreme Gradient Boosting) XGboost and (gate recurrent unit) GRU algorithms that generate all possible orders’ lists/route in 1.2586 sec with RMSE 0.01395 and called “initial layout structure”, which is filtered in the 3rd stage via creating their shortest route via hybridising (Ant Colony Optimisation) ACO and GRU algorithms with innovative tuning parameters to give workers to pick up more items in minimum time to accelerate preparing orders “priority pace motion”. The 3rd creates the minimum route via two steps, the 1st the original route sketched in Map(A), which is tracked until out of the determined zone of orders picked, then updates the remaining route via a nine-step approach hybridised to get the shortest route served more customers as sketched in Map ( B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ) to accelerate the total order collection in the 2nd step. The proposed model called “Acceleration Customer Orders’ Preparation” (ACOP). The challenge lies in assigning a new order to Map (A) lists and creating Map ( B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ). The paper presents innovative tuning parameters for ACO that help in accelerating orders preparation by 152.49%/worker/day. According to OEE, the proposed strategy is approximately 88% effective. The ACO_GRU superior to Regular Ant Colony (RgACO), Elitist Ant Colony (EACO), Ranked Ant Colony (RnACO), Best-Worst Ant Colony (BWACO), Min-Max Ant Colony (MMACO), Mat-ACO, A ^\ast algorithm, Dijkstra’s algorithm, and MRL-SA with 19%, 16%, 9%, 12%, 6%, 6%, 5%, 5%, 3%, respectively. Choosing a suitable hybridization model according to order contents increased the customer serviced mainly by 52.5% daily.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Location Intelligence Based Smart E-Commerce Platform for Residential Real-Estate Industry</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Making the decision to purchase or invest in real estate can be a very crucial process due to its high financial risk. The purchasing decision of residential real estate properties can be even more decisive because, apart from the financial risk, the choice of a property can have a great impact on the future lifestyle of the buyer. When considering residential real estate, one major factor to be considered is the property location. This research sought to determine the applicability of modern technologies such as location intelligence and machine learning in the development of an e-commerce system that may assist users in making optimal residential real estate location decisions. Third-party web APIs were used to obtain location data, and as a result of the study, methodologies were defined to convert location data into meaningful insights by using statistical methods like weighted sum and the analytical hierarchy process. The functionalities in the proposed system have been designed, considering the roles of both buyers and sellers in the real estate business. In the proposed system, the location quality index framework provides overall insights on the location, the personalized insights and alternative locations are generated via the personal preference-based suitability analyzer and the price prediction system provides the current and future price fluctuations. The usefulness of image processing technologies and machine learning for making the sellers’ journey easier on a real estate platform has also been assessed.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Leveraging knowledge of Previous Baskets to Anticipate online Buyer Behaviour</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customer behavior prediction is an important task for any company to improve the sale of product. Retailer used Market Basket Analysis pattern of customer to identify the behavior of customers. On the basis of previous basket analysis one most important feature suggestion for customer for next purchasing. Market Basket Analysis was successfully applied to evaluate a large amount of data to understand customer behavior of purchasing patterns. To facilitate reordering and maintaining adequate product stock, this paper will explain how Instacart can use its consumer transaction history and concentrate on descriptive analysis of customer buying habits, objects frequently purchased around each other, and units purchased from of the shop. Additionally, to locate client subsets and cluster with similar purchasing habits and to visualize the data to make useful recommendations geared toward enhancing revenue and satisfaction using segment and forecasting framework. In this paper design a machine learning framework to forecast whichever previously purchased item will be in the customer future purchasing. Proposed model has high accuracy on the same data set is 74.16 percent.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>ES_Use: An Efficient Rating Prediction Method</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In an online shop scenario, learning high-quality product embedding that captures various aspects of the product is important to improve the accuracy of user rating prediction. There is a lot of research about product embedding learning, for example, the side information which is the fusion of user feedback and the appearance of a product. However, because of the diversity of a product’s aspects, taking into account only its appearance as side information is not sufficient to accurately learn its embedding. In this paper, we present a matrix co-factorization method that employs information hidden in the so-called “also-viewed” or “also-bought” products, i.e., a list of products that have also been viewed or have also been bought by a user who has viewed a target product. To improve the accuracy of the rating prediction, our first step is to find out similar users. However, suppose the dataset is very large, e.g., if we have to deal with tens of millions of users’ data, the similarity calculation among users will be very time-consuming. For dealing with this problem, we use a compact binary sketch (i.e. ES, Even Sketch for user similarity estimation) to estimate user similarity. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison with a state-of-the-art baseline in generating high-accuracy rating prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Determining Investment Opportunities and Directions for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applied to Digital Twin Technology in Semiconductor Manufacturing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) established a United States (US)-based industrial Artificial Intelligence (AI) consortium to address the high-priority technical barriers in semiconductor manufacturing high-mix production and provide a roadmap for US manufacturers to improve overall competitiveness in a global marketplace. As part of this process, challenge categories were defined, with a key challenge category being &quot;Digital Twin&quot; (DT). In investigating this challenge category, it was determined that DTs are already being successfully leveraged in the industry for solutions such as predictive maintenance and model-based process control, however significant opportunities exist if investment is focused on key AI and Machine Learning (ML) areas. This document is a position paper presenting challenges, potential solutions and a roadmap for advancing DTs and associated AI in the manufacturing space. A key conclusion is the need for technical DT and DT framework standards, including a taxonomy and definition of interfaces. With these standards in place, opportunities exist for improvement of existing DT-driven capabilities, as well as realization of new capabilities, especially those resulting from the interoperability DT classes throughout the manufacturing ecosystem.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Cloud-Based Returns Management Solutions in Logistics Using K-Nearest Neighbors Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Efficiently handling returns is one of the specific issues for the e-commerce logistics providers. Using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method, this research proposes a cloud-based returns management system that may improve the efficiency of managing return procedures. Traditional methods of returns management often include human intervention in the form of sorting and decision-making, which may result in unnecessary delays and higher expenses. This technology automates decision-making based on similarity criteria between returned products and current inventory, streamlining the returns process. The proposed method effectively assigns returned items to the most appropriate disposition, whether it restocks, refurbishing, or disposal, by using the scalability and computing capacity of cloud infrastructure. Cloud computing also allows for real-time data processing, which speeds up decision-making and makes operations more agile in general. The system may improve e-commerce logistics returns management via a case study and simulation analysis, demonstrating its efficacy and efficiency. It helps move the needle on how e-commerce operations use cloud computing and machine learning, which in turn enhances competitiveness and consumer happiness in the ever-changing online marketplace.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Dropshipping Using Current Market Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This project presents a data-driven dropshipping recommendation system that leverages deep learning techniques to provide real-time, personalized product suggestions based on market analysis and customer feedback. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on static data, this system integrates GPT-based price trend analysis and BERT-based sentiment analysis to identify products with both high market demand and positive customer reviews. The GPT model analyzes price trends to classify products within desirable price ranges, while the BERT model evaluates customer feedback to filter out products with poor sentiment. The combined output from these models is used to select the most promising products, which are then displayed on a custom-built, user-friendly website. This integrated approach ensures that the dropshipping business can adapt to changing market trends and customer preferences, offering a curated selection of products that enhance customer satisfaction and drive sales. The system thus provides an efficient solution for dropshippers seeking to improve product selection, customer engagement, and overall business growth.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multi-Layer Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the realm of practical e-commerce applications, the significance of recommendation algorithms is indisputable. Traditional approaches often narrowly concentrate on a singular aspect of a product, overlooking the intricate array of attributes that characterize each offering. Consequently, this paper introduces a recommendation algorithm grounded in a sophisticated multi-layer self-attention mechanism. The objective is to enhance recommendation accuracy by comprehensively leveraging the diverse feature attributes of products.Init-ially, we harness the self-attention mechanism to internally compute the product features, meticulously capturing the essence and importance of each attribute. This approach enables us to discern which features contribute significantly to the overall representation of a product. Subsequently, through the application of a cross-self-attention mechanism, we delve deeper into the intricate interactions and associations among these features. This analysis uncovers latent relationships and synergies that might otherwise be overlooked.Finally, we consolidate these insights by concatenating the computed results and feeding them into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. This network is adept at capturing temporal dependencies and patterns, enabling us to predict and recommend products that align most closely with user preferences.Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of enhancing recommendation accuracy. This innovative approach not only advances the field of recommendation systems but also holds promise for revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape by delivering more personalized and relevant recommendations to users.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A research attempt to predict and model personalities through users' social media details</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Users of products and services, as human beings have a wide range of personalities. This is being experienced right from the initial days of e-commerce and m-commerce in India. In this research an attempt has been made to predict personalities using MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator) based approach making use of natural language based processing, machine learning and transformer based modelling. As each human being is unique and exhibits different personality trait, therefore it is impractical to offer a generalized treatment for all users. But it is possible to categorize individuals, in terms of their defining characteristics based on MBTI based approach, which groups personalities/users into 16 groups and thus helps in predicting personalities. In this study authors made an attempt to extract social media based information of users through their accounts to characterize users into one of the 16 MBTI personality types. For this prediction and modelling, authors made use of pre-processed data from Kaggle, which was then fed into the transformer for modelling/processing. Based on the information it gets, like comments, post captions, reviews, etc., the transformer is fine-tuned to predict the user's personality. The required qualities of the model were taken into account while coding the transformer's parameters. Additionally, an attempt is also made to compare the outcomes of two trained transformer models. Authors report that the prediction accuracy of their modelling as 64%, outperforming all other models used. The testing data had a 76% precision.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep-Sentiment: An Effective Deep Sentiment Analysis Using a Decision-Based Recurrent Neural Network (D-RNN)</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Sentiment analysis is a sub-domain in opinion mining that extracts sentiments from the users’ opinions from text messages. Opinions from E-commerce websites, blogs, online social media, etc., and these opinions are in the form of text, suggestions, and comments. This paper describes the new sentiment analysis model to predict sentiments effectively that can be used to improve product quality and sales. The proposed approach is an integrated model combining several techniques, such as the pre-trained model BERT-large-cased (BLC) for training the dataset. BLC model contains 24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameters. Optimization algorithms can fine-tune pre-trained models, such as BERT, for sentiment analysis tasks. Fine-tuning involves training the pre-trained model on a specific sentiment analysis task to improve performance. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the optimized algorithm that helps to analyze the sentiments effectively from the given datasets. The next step is the combination of pre-processing techniques such as Tokenization, Stop Word Removal, etc. The next step focused on Bag-of-Words (BoW) and word embedding techniques like Word2Vec used to extract the features from the datasets. The deep sentiment analysis (DSA) based classification is designed to classify the sentiments based on aspect and priority model to achieve better results. The proposed model combines Aspect and Priority-based Sentiment analysis with a Decision-based Recurrent Neural Network (D-RNN). The experiments are conducted using Twitter, Restaurant, and Laptop datasets available publicly on Kaggle—the proposed model’s performance is analyzed using a confusion matrix. The proposed approach addresses various challenges in analyzing the sentiment analysis. Python programming language with several libraries such as Keras, Pandas, and others extracts the sentiments from given datasets. The comparison between the existing and proposed models shows the effectiveness of the sentiment outputs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Prediction on Customer's Purchasing Decision based on Machine Learning Classification and Regression Models</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study investigates whether users will place an order for a specific item on an e-commerce platform (using JD.com as a case study) based on the comprehensive consideration of all available information. U sing machine learning methods, it analyzes a wide range of related factors to predict purchasing decisions. The dataset is preprocessed and feature-engineered to train predictive models. Key algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic regression, are used for classification tasks, with hyperparameter tuning to ensure optimal performance. In the study, the Random Forest model demonstrates remarkable performance, achieving an accuracy score of 0.999817 and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.9998, reflecting a high probability of precise predictions. Notably, the features with the most significant predictive contributions are identified as the product's coupon discount level and quantity discount level, collectively accounting for over 50% of the predictive power. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analyses by offering a data-driven approach to understanding and predicting consumer behavior, with potential applications in personalized recommendations and marketing strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Attention long short-term memory-based website analysis on the impact of cross-border electronic commerce on online consumer behavior</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Good website design can guide consumers more convenient to find the desired goods, more easily familiar with the website function, more convenient for a series of operations. But the existing website design relies on the traditional method, cannot recommend the real suitable products for consumers. This paper proposes an Attention Long Short-Term Memory (ALSTM) model designed to enhance website service quality in cross-border e-commerce by effectively analyzing and predicting consumer behavior. The ALSTM model leverages LSTM layers to capture the sequential patterns of user click behaviors, while an attention mechanism is applied to prioritize relevant product attributes based on consumer interactions. By dynamically adjusting to consumer preferences, the model provides personalized product recommendations, ultimately improving user engagement and purchase potential. Experimental results demonstrate that the ALSTM model outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving substantial improvements in mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) on the Ciao dataset, underscoring its efficacy in delivering accurate and adaptive recommendations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>X-Ray: Mechanical Search for an Occluded Object by Minimizing Support of Learned Occupancy Distributions</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>For applications in e-commerce, warehouses, healthcare, and home service, robots are often required to search through heaps of objects to grasp a specific target object. For mechanical search, we introduce X-Ray, an algorithm based on learned occupancy distributions. We train a neural network using a synthetic dataset of RGBD heap images labeled for a set of standard bounding box targets with varying aspect ratios. X-Ray minimizes support of the learned distribution as part of a mechanical search policy in both simulated and real environments. We benchmark these policies against two baseline policies on 1,000 heaps of 15 objects in simulation where the target object is partially or fully occluded. Results suggest that X-Ray is significantly more efficient, as it succeeds in extracting the target object 82% of the time, 15% more often than the best-performing baseline. Experiments on an ABB YuMi robot with 20 heaps of 25 household objects suggest that the learned policy transfers easily to a physical system, where it outperforms baseline policies by 15% in success rate with 17% fewer actions.

        <dc:title>Automated Shopping Cart Using RFID with a Collaborative Clustering Driven Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recent advancements in technology have seen a significant reduction in human intervention. New technologies are introduced to replace outdated conventions where emphasis is put on the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence and Automation in our daily lives. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, reducing human interaction in everyday actions has now been deemed necessary. One of the most important sectors affected, the shopping industry, needs to adapt to meet government and social security standards. This paper addresses a Smart Shopping Cart System where the entire shopping experience is automated and handled by the customer. It details a more efficient online mode of shopping which not only reduces the need for hands-on staff but also provides specialized recommendations to users using collaborative clustering to update the shopping experience and meet the demands of our time. The current shopping system has many limitations, and introduction of Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology as the core identification mechanism can prove useful for applications such as security, safety and inventory management.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Analysing and Predicting the purchases done on the day of Black Friday</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>On the eve of Black Friday, goods are sold at a very high discount and thus increases the sales around 30 folds as compared to the normal flash sale days. The customer’s data those have bought products on this day can be analyzed which will give a brief declaration of their choice on various products. Here, we have analyzed the data containing the tuples of customers along with their buying factors and amount. This data is analyzed and predicted just to provide special discounts on goods for the customers according to their taste and buying budget. Four models that are xgboost, tfidftransform, both combination and extra trees regressor have been used for the prediction for different distributions of training and testing data (50:50, 70:30, 30:70) and for a separate sample training dataset and testing dataset which includes further two cases of prediction. These two cases consist of predicting and testing on the same dataset and predicting on the training dataset and testing it on a separate testing data set. Analysis is done (Exploratory data analysis) on the dataset to understand the customer behavior and patterns of various products popularity during the sale. Feature importance and gain importance are shown for all five cases. The accuracy results are highlighted in the form of root mean square error (RMSE) score and the accuracy of all the models in different cases have been depicted in the form of their accuracy graphs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Comparison of Text Classification Methods: Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine for E-Commerce Item Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Currently, buying products from the e-commerce industry has already become the norm for many people. It is important to categorize the item that is sold in e-commerce so that the customer can easily find the item they want to buy and have a better experience browsing through the application. We have found a dataset to use for our experiment that we will preprocess so we can use it without any problem. The experiment will consist of looking for the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of each algorithm with the dataset we use and compare it so we can find which algorithm is better. Out of 6 experiments we have done, we found out that SVM outperforms Naive Bayes four times. From that we can conclude that SVM is overall better than Naive Bayes with 96.6% accuracy and 0.967 F1-Score.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A significant economic engine is agriculture. It is essential for a thriving ecology. A vast variety of agricultural goods are essential to human life in practically every way. Farmers must adapt to climate change while supplying more food grains of higher quality to a growing global population. Knowing the soil's nutritional composition and climatic circumstances will help the farmer choose the best crop to plant in those conditions and increase crop output and growth. This data is to be collected using specialized sensors which will be fed to the pre-trained machine learning model through a hardware interface that offers suggestion of appropriate crops for the data supplied. The model is deployed in a Web application using the FLASK framework which provides interface between the model and the web application. The study has been made on various prediction algorithms to suggest the best crop to obtain its maximum yield. In the agricultural industry, machine learning techniques are employed to increase crop output and quality. The suggestion of an ideal crop can be aided by the use of relevant algorithms using sensed data. In addition, users can send purchase request and they can purchase products such as fertilizers, pesticides, weedicide, manure through website. Vendors can show their products for sale conveniently.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Evaluation of KNN-NMF Algorithm for Recommendation Systems in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Due to growth in e-commerce, recommender systems have gained importance in providing recommendations to the user to help him or her make a choice. These systems not only assist the users in searching through the extensive product list but also increase businesses’ productivity by recommending products. The aim of this project is to suggest a hybrid recommender system which combines the aspects of collaborative and content-based filtering so as to enhance the efficiency of the recommendation system in e-commerce. In addition, it is to evaluate the performance of this model with the individual collaborative and content-based models. The study involved creating the CF and CBF models with the various algorithms like the Matrix Factorization, KNN, SVD, and the TF-IDF vectorization. The best models from CF and CBF were then combined with a Hybrid Filtering (HF) model by using weighted and switching combination to enhance the model’s effectiveness. The performance of the CF, CBF and the HF models was compared, in order to check if the proposed hybrid approach is better than the existing models. The results of the experiment show that the hybrid switching model provided better results than the CF and CBF models on their own. The hybrid filtering model had also managed to reduce the RMSE to \mathbf1. 0 6 5 and improved precision to 83.2%. This demonstrates the advantage of the proposed model over the traditional CF and CBF approaches. Our study validates that the hybrid filtering recommender system, especially the switching combination strategy, outperformed the traditional standalone models by integrating the benefits of both collaborative and content-based filtering. This provides a good starting point for future work and there are many directions in which the research can be expanded.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Towards Smarter Supply Chains: Machine Learning Methodologies for Delivery Risk Assessment</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Supply chain management (SCM) has evolved into a core strategic component for enterprises seeking to gain a competitive edge in an increasingly interconnected global marketplace. With the ever-growing complexity and volume of data available-from procurement and production to distribution and last-mile delivery-organizations are turning to machine learning (ML) and big data analytics to optimize performance and stream-line operations. In this paper, we explore how integrating machine learning into various stages of the supply chain can unlock efficiencies, reduce delivery risks, and enable more informed, data-driven decisions. We employ the DataCo Global Supply Chain dataset as a case study to illustrate how ML classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, can be leveraged to predict late deliveries. Our results show that Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (over 93%), demonstrating its superior ability to identify at-risk shipments. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of data exploration, feature engineering, and the critical need for addressing data imbalance in ensuring robust model performance. The discussion underscores the transformative potential of ML for improving supply chain efficiency, resilience, and strategic decision-making, while also highlighting future directions to handle evolving customer demands and emerging challenges in an era of rapidly expanding data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>HT-FVD: Hybrid Transformer Framework for Fine-Grained Vulnerability Detection in Third-Party Libraries</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To address the limitations of existing methods in third-party library (TPL) vulnerability identification—such as poor cross-platform compatibility and incomplete vulnerability reports, we propose HT-FVD (Hybrid Transformer Framework for Fine-Grained Vulnerability Detection), a novel deep learning framework integrating pre-trained language models (PLMs) with custom Transformer layers. HT-FVD leverages multi-source features—including vulnerability descriptions, normalized Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) configurations, reference links, and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) database matches—which are encoded into fine-grained feature vectors via PLMs. These vectors are processed through a custom Transformer module with scaled dot-product attention and feed-forward networks to enable multi-label vulnerability classification. Evaluated on 7,696 vulnerability entities and 4,682 TPL labels, HT-FVD achieves state-of-the-art fine-grained detection performance with an average F1@k of 0.71, outperforming baselines by 6–7%. Ablation studies confirm its sensitivity to learning rates and architectural flexibility in adapting diverse PLMs. The framework eliminates platform-specific dependencies, providing a robust and extensible solution for secure TPL recommendation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Style Synthesis: AI-Powered Dress Try-On Experience</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the world of internet retail and fashion, virtual try-on systems have become a game changing innovation. This research introduces a revolutionary deep learning-based method for virtual try-on. The method first segments the clothing from the source image using segmentation techniques, then creates an interactive image to provide a virtual fitting experience, and finally combines accurate posture recognition using pretrained models with the imposition of the garment texture on the dense pose it predicted. Realtime experimenting with different clothing items, sizes, and positions is possible because to the interactive user interface. The technology is more user friendly because it can accommodate a variety of body types. This virtual try-on system, powered by deep learning, has the potential to significantly change customer involvement across a variety of industries, especially in fashion and ecommerce, by transforming the fashion retail scene.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Prosumer Participation in a Transactive Energy Marketplace: A Game-Theoretic Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a framework of transactive energy marketplace (TEM) in a community microgrid with multiple prosumers as market participants for facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading with demand response consideration. The internal market prices are determined using generation-to-demand ratio with the help of transactive energy market operator (TEMO). The TEMO is a non-profited retail energy manager that aims to enable prosumers to participate in the TEM, and to sustain equilibrium between community generation and demand. The participants in TEM are encouraged to trade their net demand with the neighborhood besides the upstream utility. The interactions between TEMO and prosumers are modeled with the game-theory. The optimal time slots for the schedulable loads of the prosumers in TEM are obtained using genetic algorithm while optimizing the energy bills. With the presented system, the reduction in the community energy bills is in the range of 18-52% in the P2P marketplace compared to conventional peer-to-grid (P2G) marketplace under different scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Amazon Product Recommendation System Using Apache Spark</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Personalized product recommendations have emerged as a crucial component of the user experience and commercial success in the age of e-commerce. The Product Recommendation System using Apache Spark ML libraries is a data-driven system that makes advantage of the distributed computing capabilities of Apache Spark to offer users customized suggestions. In this paper, we used the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) model and Single Value Decomposition (SVD) model to develop a product collaborative filtering approach-based recommendation system to predict the top products. Our suggested system makes a list of predictions for the highest ratings using the recommender engine. We performed the experimental analysis successfully and obtained the lowest root mean squared errors (RMSEs) for SVD and ALS of 1.098 and 0.866 to 1.247, respectively. ALS is therefore regarded as the best for making product recommendations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Excavating Multimodal Correlation for Movie Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommendation mechanisms, which aid users in navigating the deluge of information at their disposal, have become more popular as e-commerce applications have grown. In streaming services for movies, where tailored content and services are crucial, these technologies are particularly significant. But these algorithms frequently run into the issue of scant data, which makes it challenging to formulate precise suggestions. This research presents a customized deep learning-inspired multi-modal movie referral system to solve this problem. This system basically enhances the correlation between different pairs of attributes to get the highly correlated multimodal features. The correlation-based mechanism mines the hidden properties of different attributes (movie_id, movie_title, movie_description, and movie_poster) individually and the properties based on the dependency of one attribute on another. These hidden properties give a high contribution to movie score prediction. The study in this paper justifies that the multimodal features based on the correlation between different attributes enhance systems that provide suggestions. This strategy may result in many relevant suggestions and enhance user interfaces, especially for movie streaming services where customers seek much relevant products and services. The system analyzes the performance of the proposed recommendation approach using the IMDB Vision and NLP datasets and the results outperform the existing methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Propensity modelling for predicting customer behaviour using clustering techniques for effective business analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The digital world generates massive volumes of data, and it is critical to analyse them. With machine learning and powerful visualization tools, the competition to innovate and succeed in this industry has made a significant leap towards tailoring data-driven solutions. Analyzing these data has never been easier and the insights gathered can transform many businesses. In this paper, four different clustering techniques were compared namely, K-means, Agglomerative, Birch, and Spectral clustering. Three separate performance metrics were used to find the effectiveness of these algorithms: the Silhouette coefficient, the Calinski-Harabasz score, and the Davies-Bouldin index. Based on the analysis, it was found that the K-means clustering algorithm outscored the other three by a higher performance measure score. The insights gathered from clustering led to the formulation of critical business strategies. This study also provides an in-depth look into expressing corporate strategies with advanced machine learning technologies. There are several applications to it, including classification, clustering, prediction, and big data visualization.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Learnings from a Retail Recommendation System on Billions of Interactions at bol.com</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender systems are ubiquitous in the modern internet, where they help users find items they might like. We discuss the design of a large-scale recommender system handling billions of interactions on a European e-commerce platform.We present two studies on enhancing the predictive performance of this system with both algorithmic and systems-related approaches. First, we evaluate neural network-based approaches on proprietary data from our e-commerce platform, and confirm recent results outlining that the benefits of these methods with respect to predictive performance are limited, while they exhibit severe scalability bottlenecks. Next, we investigate the impact of a reduction of the response latency of our serving system, and conduct an A/B test on the live platform with more than 19 million user sessions, which confirms that the latency reduction of the recommender system correlates with a significant increase in business-relevant metrics. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to real world recommendation systems and future research on scalable session-based recommendation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>JPAVE: A Generation and Classification-based Model for Joint Product Attribute Prediction and Value Extraction</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product attribute value extraction is an important task in e-Commerce which can help several downstream applications such as product search and recommendation. Most previous models handle this task using sequence labeling or question answering method which rely on the sequential position information of values in the product text and are vulnerable to data discrepancy between training and testing. This limits their generalization ability to real-world scenario in which each product can have multiple descriptions across various shopping platforms with different composition of text and style. They also have limited zero-shot ability to new values. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning model with value generation/classification and attribute prediction called JPAVE to predict values without the necessity of position information of values in the text. Furthermore, the copy mechanism in value generator and the value attention module in value classifier help our model address the data discrepancy issue by only focusing on the relevant part of input text and ignoring other information which causes the discrepancy issue such as sentence structure in the text. Besides, two variants of our model are designed for open-world and closed-world scenarios. In addition, copy mechanism introduced in the first variant based on value generation can improve its zero-shot ability for identifying unseen values. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with strong baselines and its generalization ability of predicting new values.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Development of Recommender Systems for Better Services and Products using Data Science</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Online social networking and e-commerce are becoming increasingly popular. Recommender Systems (RS) let users find relevant information from several possibilities. Internet applications currently need RS. This technology uses huge data to provide customized suggestions to improve customer happiness. Concerns and ideas help customers choose items. Sentiment Analysis (SA) may increase RS recommendation accuracy by improving user behaviour, views, and responses. RS solves information overload in information retrieval, but data sparsity remains a big problem. SA is notable for reading text and expressing user preferences. It helps E-Commerce to monitor product feedback and to understand what client wants and their preferences. This research presents a hybrid recommendation approach to increase RS accuracy and correctness. The hybrid approach beats standard models in several assessment criteria. Modern retailing businesses’ e-commerce operations are impossible without RSs. The content-based and context-aware techniques are hybridized for providing promising results. Content-based approaches connect consumers to new things based on prior ratings and activities. Create user profiles and classify it. Knowledge-based algorithms propose customized items with minimal use history. These systems use case-based recommendations or limitations to make recommendations. Finally, ensemble recommender systems combine data source prediction power.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimization of Dynamic Pricing in E-Commerce Platform with Demand Side Management using Fuzzy Logic System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In e-commerce platforms, dynamic pricing has drawn a lot of attention as a potent tactic to boost sales and improve consumer happiness. But monitoring and comprehending client demand is crucial to the success of dynamic pricing. This study suggests an optimization framework for demand-side management that incorporates fuzzy logic into dynamic pricing in e-commerce platforms. To represent and capture the uncertainty and imprecision present in client demand, the suggested framework makes use of fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic makes it possible to represent and work with linguistic variables, which makes decision-making more adaptable and natural. The approach takes into account the influence of customer behavior and preferences on pricing decisions by incorporating demand-side management. There are two primary steps in the optimization process. First, a fuzzy demand model is created to estimate consumer demand based on a variety of inputs, including pricing, product qualities, and customer traits. This model offers a quantitative knowledge of consumer behavior under various pricing conditions. Second, a pricing plan that maximizes platform profit while accounting for customer happiness and demand changes is determined using an optimization algorithm. By providing personalized pricing based on consumer preferences, the optimized pricing strategy increases revenue while also enhancing customer happiness. Demand-side management and fuzzy logic are combined to improve decision-making and help e-commerce platforms adjust to shifting consumer preferences and market conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Measuring the Role of Trust and Information Quality on Intention to Use AI Chatbots in Mobile Shopping: A Structured Equation Modeling Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in online shopping platforms has gained traction, offering personalized assistance and enhancing the customer experience. However, ensuring consumer acceptance and adoption of these conversational agents remains a challenge. The present research examines the elements shaping consumer perspectives and objectives regarding the utilization of AI chatbots in mobile shopping applications by proposing an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework. Drawing from prior literature, the model incorporates constructs such as trust, information quality to the traditional TAM. 309 usable responses were collected through online survey and analyzed through Structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings reveal that usefulness, attitude, trust, and information quality significantly influence consumers' intentions to use AI chatbots for mobile shopping. Additionally, perceived ease of use emerged as a significant predictor of perceived usefulness, while perceived usefulness positively affected attitude toward using. This research enriches the current understanding by furnishing empirical data on the factors driving the adoption of AI chatbots within the realm of mobile shopping. Discussions delve into theoretical and practical implications, underscoring the significance of designing chatbots that are valuable, user-friendly, trustworthy, and informative to cultivate consumer acceptance. Limitations and future research directions are also outlined.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Customer Loyalty and Retention Analysis Using Hybrid Strategy</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customer loyalty and Retention are important factors for the success of E- Commerce, as companies attempt to keep customers over the long term. This research employs machine learning methodologies applied on Online Retail Dataset taken from UCI repository in order to identify customer retention behavior and forecast loyalty. Three machine learning models namely XGBoost, K-Means and Random Forest are used to categorize customers into high, medium, and low categories based on buying rate, recentness, and budgetary value. The considered methodologies are compared based on the most important performance measures of Precision, Accuracy, Recall and Scalability in order to select the optimal solution for customer retention prediction. The findings show that the highest predictive accuracy of 92.1 % is achieved by XGBoost, and K-Means Clustering successfully clusters customers into high-value, at-risk, and churned segments. The Random Forest delivers insightful feature importance analysis, which identifies the most important retention drivers, including frequency of purchase and recency. These findings assist companies in creating customized marketing strategies, pre-emptive churn prevention, and segment-specific customer engagement programs. This research incorporates predictive modeling (Random Forest &amp; XGBoost) and customer segmentation (K-Means), providing a hybrid solution that supports both retention prediction and customer classification. While most research aims at a single model for retaining customers, this research compares Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Means Clustering to establish the best strategy for prediction as well as segmentation. The knowledge obtained from this analysis allows companies to apply customized marketing strategies, minimize churn, and maximize long-term profitability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unmask inflated product reviews through Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product reviews play a crucial role in online customer purchase decisions. In today’s marketplaces, such as Amazon, the quantity and interest of product reviews is growing, along with fierce competition between sellers. At the same time, the phenomenon of fake reviews is ever-growing. Many proposals capable of detecting fake reviews based on Machine Learning (ML) exist in literature. Nevertheless, bad practices implemented by the sellers make genuine reviews difficult to recognize. For instance, some Telegram Channels are known for giving products for free in exchange for 5-star reviews. This work focuses on the analysis of two review data streams of Amazon products. The first one is composed of the reviews corresponding to the products in the AmazonBasics category. The latter collects reviews of the products in the Telegram channels mentioned above. The analysis reveals a substantial dissimilarity between the two sources of reviews, that conducts to the construction of a ground truth dataset employed in the classification model training. The classification activity can assist during product rating interpretation, which could be invalidated by too many fake reviews. The experimental results reveal that 1&amp;2-star reviews are good predictors of the review’s trustworthiness and the product itself.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Modeling Fashion Influence From Photos</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The evolution of clothing styles and their migration across the world is intriguing, yet difficult to describe quantitatively. We propose to discover and quantify fashion influences from catalog and social media photos. We explore fashion influence along two channels: geolocation and fashion brands. We introduce an approach that detects which of these entities influence which other entities in terms of propagating their styles. We then leverage the discovered influence patterns to inform a novel forecasting model that predicts the future popularity of any given style within any given city or brand. To demonstrate our idea, we leverage public large-scale datasets of 7.7M Instagram photos from 44 major world cities (where styles are worn with variable frequency) as well as 41K Amazon product photos (where styles are purchased with variable frequency). Our model learns directly from the image data how styles move between locations and how certain brands affect each other's designs in a predictable way. The discovered influence relationships reveal how both cities and brands exert and receive fashion influence for an array of visual styles inferred from the images. Furthermore, the proposed forecasting model achieves state-of-the-art results for challenging style forecasting tasks. Our results indicate the advantage of grounding visual style evolution both spatially and temporally, and for the first time, they quantify the propagation of inter-brand and inter-city influences.

        <dc:title>A Multi-Objective Recommender System for Enhanced Consumer Behavior Prediction in E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the proliferation of online shopping, consumers are inundated with an overwhelming number of product choices, often leading to decision fatigue and abandoned shopping carts. To mitigate this issue, recommender systems have been employed to personalize the shopping experience and enhance consumer engagement. However, traditional recommender systems typically focus on single-objective optimization, such as predicting clicks or purchases, which limits their effectiveness. In this study, we propose a multi-objective recommender system designed to simultaneously optimize multiple consumer behaviors, including clicks, cart additions, and completed orders. Leveraging the OTTO Recommender Systems Dataset, our system employs a two-stage candidate reranker model that first generates a pool of potential items and then ranks them based on predicted relevance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an ensemble model combining LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost Rankers outperforms individual models, achieving superior recall rates. This multi-objective approach provides a comprehensive solution for enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of recommender systems in e-commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Energy System Simulation Models Adapted to the Development of a High Proportion of Renewable Energy - A Systematic Review</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The development of future integrated energy systems (IES) targeting high-proportion renewable energy integration necessitates selecting appropriate energy models aligned with research objectives, as simulations are critical for evaluating renewable energy deployment pathways. Current energy system models, categorized into bottom-up, top-down, computable general equilibrium (CGE), and optimization frameworks, address distinct aspects: bottom-up models identify technology-specific solutions, top-down tools forecast macroeconomic trends, CGE models analyze multi-market dynamics, and optimization models determine cost-effective technology portfolios. While studies have explored individual tools and limited comparative analyses, gaps persist in systematic evaluations of the 37 prevalent models. Model selection varies significantly based on scope, sectoral focus, and renewable integration strategies. For instance, EnergyPRO assesses power plant feasibility, WASP calculates renewable capacity requirements, and PERSEUS/STREAM model electric vehicle adoption, whereas MiniCAM and UniSyD3.0 incorporate hydrogen vehicles for enhanced flexibility. Only 10 tools, including EnergyPLAN and MARKAL/TIMES, holistically integrate power, heating, and transportation sectors. Challenges remain in addressing renewable system complexity, parameter uncertainty, and policy relevance. To overcome these, this study proposes the EnergyPLAN model, leveraging hourly-scale data and multisector synergies, combined with genetic algorithm-driven optimization to mitigate uncertainties and deliver robust, policy-relevant solutions for high-renewable IES planning.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Checkout Conversion Rates Through Machine Learning and UI/UX Design Patterns</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This research investigates the effect of UI/UX design patterns on e-commerce checkout conversion rates with machine learning methods. Based on 5,000 simulated or actual checkout sessions, we measure the effect of the most important design factors, such as button contrast, form field quantity, load time, responsiveness on mobile, guest checkout, and autofill. Different machine learning models were used, and the highest accuracy rate was recorded by Logistic Regression at 87%. The findings indicate that high-contrast buttons and minimal field numbers substantially enhance conversion rates. On the basis of these conclusions, we recommend a unified design framework, keeping usability, efficiency, and trust with users in harmony. This is a working guideline for e-commerce business decision-makers, designers, and developers to decrease cart abandonment and overall checkout performance. By offering measurable insights and actionable suggestions, the research fills the gap between design taste and data-driven optimization, adding valuable evidence to the emerging discipline of conversion-focused UI/UX design in e-commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This work illustrates the initial results obtained within the scope of the WebLand project, presenting the needs, industrial factors and methodology used in the development of a digital solution aimed at the bolota trade in Portugal, valuing the value chain of this abundant product. The project envisages the development of a marketplace platform that allows tracking national acorn production, predicting supply and searching, as well as assisting in choosing logistical routes for transporting this material. The platform's functionalities are supported by artificial intelligence algorithms for analyzing complex data and dynamic routes considering conditioning factors in the process of purchasing and using this product and by-products through convulational models. The data collection, its normalization and characterization in relation to the different ones are specific results of the initial activities, also presented in this work, which support the implementation of the data model in the concept of valuing acorns as an option to conventional products. The proposed solution within the scope of this project foresees and idealizes assistance in making logistical decisions with the intention of reducing the desperation of agricultural production, quickly connecting classes in the value chain and reducing the environmental footprint associated with acorns.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>KNN-based Precision Marketing Data Mining Algorithm for E-business Platform</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The development of e-business industry is undoubtedly the needs of both the state and the society. With the continuous improvement of the online shopping system, consumers' consumption psychology and consumption form are changing, and they are more and more fond of businesses that can provide personalized and customized services. Based on the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm of artificial intelligence machine learning, this paper analyzes the potential consumption demand of customers, and realizes the prediction of the consumption behavior of target users, thus contributing to the precise marketing of e-business products. The results show that the algorithm is more accurate in the prediction of consumers' consumption tendency on e-business platform, which is 23.25% higher than the traditional CNN algorithm. Therefore, the precision marketing system model of e-business products designed in this paper has high precision in predicting consumers' purchase intention, and can be used as decision-making basis for enterprises in its precision marketing. Under the data mining technology, e-business enterprises should master the consumption rules and visiting time of consumers, assist them to formulate the most appropriate network marketing strategy, and enhance their own core competitiveness in the highly competitive market.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Analysis of the use of Analytics Platform for the Commercial Value of Mud crab Production using Non-parametric Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>There are several procedures presently involving how to handle the grow-out culture method in mud crab propagation. Unfortunately, due to the lack of administration in the decision-making process, low productivity in mud crab farming remains uncontrollable. The commercial value of crabs have been sacrificed through market pricing and defining quality of crabs, most especially the S. Serrata which is invincible in price and quality. The Mud crab Analytics Platform (MAP) is a state-of-the-art innovative technology that supports the decision-making process involving the use of machine learning algorithms to calculate the units of analytics. Through the MAP, the data transformed into information to gain new knowledge until forming wisdom to decision-making. The paradigm of the mud crab analytics platform execution and control process standard (MAPExeCPS) is a guide on how the platform works following the phases; data collection, data modeling, data analytics, visualization, and decision-making. To assess the commercial value of mud crab through the use of MAP, the survey questionnaires are distributed to the respondents (N=110) and the research report is created using quantitative information. The results of statistical analyses were calculated such as measuring reliability, descriptive statistics, normality test, and non-parametric test which gave precise findings for the investigation. Therefore, it proved that satisfaction upon using the analytics platform was measured and the decision-makers are more likely satisfied with their works for managing mud crab farming to increase the commercial value of their product.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Graph-Aware Deep Fusion Networks for Online Spam Review Detection</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product reviews on e-commerce platforms play a critical role in shaping users’ purchasing decisions. Unfortunately, online reviews sometimes can be intentionally misleading to manipulate the ecosystem. To date, existing methods to automatically detect “spam reviews” either focus on sophisticated feature engineering with traditional classification models or rely on tuning neural networks with aggregated features. In this article, we develop a novel graph-based model, namely, graph-aware deep fusion networks (GDFNs) that use information from relevant metadata (review text, features of users, and items) and relational data (network) to capture the semantic information from their complex heterogeneous interactions via graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Besides, GDFN also uses a novel fusion technique to synthesize low- and high-order interactions with propagated information across multiple review-related subgraphs. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets show that our proposed model is effective and outperforms several strong state-of-the-art baselines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Automated Grocery List Generator</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The automated grocery list solution aims at addressing consumers’ frustrations with the manual list-making processes. With these methods, there is always some overlook of items to purchase, redundancy in purchasing some items, and a wastage of time in the aisles. The nonpersonalized generic shopping lists are not based on various individual preferences and usage patterns. High-End AI methodologies such as the Apriori algorithm and market basket analysis are used in order to provide a solution to the challenges common for your audience. They observe item associations and find frequent item sets, which allows the system to recommend interesting items that could be used together. In addition, the recommendation systems take previous purchase histories and user feedback into consideration to grow even more personalized. The aim of the automated grocery list system is therefore to enhance the shopping experience by streamlining the list creation process through the provision of personalized recommendations. This saves time, increases user satisfaction, and reduces the odds of forgetting items in the shopping list. In addition, this system will adapt over time and improve with use, fine-tuning its suggestions based on interactions with, and feedback from users. Finally, the automated grocery list system aspires to make shopping easier, with less stress and personalization for everyone, based on personal preferences and usage patterns.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Adversarial Training Towards Robust Multimedia Recommender System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the prevalence of multimedia content on the Web, developing recommender solutions that can effectively leverage the rich signal in multimedia data is in urgent need. Owing to the success of deep neural networks in representation learning, recent advances on multimedia recommendation has largely focused on exploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy. To date, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of multimedia representation and its impact on the performance of multimedia recommendation. In this paper, we shed light on the robustness of multimedia recommender system. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework and deep image features, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a small (but purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease the recommendation accuracy. This implies the possible weakness of multimedia recommender system in predicting user preference, and more importantly, the potential of improvement by enhancing its robustness. To this end, we propose a novel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can lead to a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial learning. The idea is to train the model to defend an adversary, which adds perturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing the model's accuracy. We conduct experiments on two representative multimedia recommendation tasks, namely, image recommendation and visually-aware product recommendation. Extensive results verify the positive effect of adversarial learning and demonstrate the effectiveness of our AMR method.

        <dc:title>Periodical Analysis of Stress in Working Professionals</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The working sectors are introducing new products and technologies to the marketplace these days, giving it a modern feel. It ultimately caused workers' stress levels to increase. With the use of sophisticated machine learning methods and picture processing, our project's main objective is to detect stress in working professionals periodically. KNN classifiers are a kind of machine learning algorithm that is used to analyze a specific employee's stress pattern and ascertain how stressed out they are frequently or monthly. The previous stress detection methods, which lacked live detection, have been enhanced by our technology. This system, however, includes live detection as well as routine employee assessments that allow for the identification of employees' levels of physical and mental stress and the provision of appropriate treatment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-ticaret Sitelerindeki Türkçe Müşteri Yorumlarının Faydalılık Tahmini Predicting the Usefulness of Turkish Consumer Reviews on E-commerce Websites</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As the world is rapidly digitalising, there is a significant transformation from traditional shopping to online shopping. Consumer reviews are of high importance for the users when shopping from e-commerce sites. When making a purchase decision, users examine consumer reviews written about the product they are considering to buy. However, since most of the consumer reviews do not contain useful information, users lose time and effort in the process of evaluating the reviews. In this study, a solution to this problem is presented by proposing an intelligent system based on artificial intelligence that can automatically distinguish the useful ones among consumer reviews. Firstly, the authors defined useful reviews for online shopping websites. Accordingly, comments with positive or negative content based on experiences about a feature of a product that may be effective in users' purchasing decisions are considered as &quot;useful reviews&quot;. Subsequently, 10,000 Turkish consumer reviews were collected from a popular e-commerce website in Turkey by web scraping method. These data were labelled by the authors according to the definition of useful reviews. After preprocessing steps were applied on the obtained dataset, BERT models, a transformer-based deep learning architecture, were used in the classification phase. As a result of the experimental studies, it was observed that useful reviews could be distinguished with high performance. In the tests in which 10-fold cross-validation was applied, the best result was achieved in the test using the ConvBERTurk model with an F1 score of 97.04% and an accuracy of 97.02%. It is thought that the proposed intelligent system can be effective in solving the problem and will facilitate users' access to useful comments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Local Energy Marketplace Agents-based Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The concept of &quot;energy prosumer&quot; is becoming an increasingly important part of our energy landscape due to the emergence of distributed energy sources, including photovoltaic (PV) technology. This new phenomenon has blurred the line between energy producers and consumers, creating a new class of prosumers. Blockchain technology has been instrumental in facilitating secure, cost-effective energy transactions between prosumers, consumers, and utilities, automating the process and making it more efficient. In the present study, an agent-based model (ABM) simulation framework for energy exchange was developed, demonstrating the power profiles of households and the operation of blockchain-aware energy transactions. The study was conducted in the Education City Community Housing (ECCH) microgrid, using a multi-agent framework for a transactive energy (TE) distributed energy resource (DER) that requires blockchain technology. The current blockchain-based local energy market (LEM) works to balance supply and demand by using precise short-term energy generation forecasts and home consumption estimates. To evaluate the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art energy forecasting methods, the researchers conducted a simulation to evaluate the accuracy of energy forecasts in predicting household energy generation and consumption. They examined the impact of forecasting errors on market outcomes under different supply scenarios. The study found that while models using long short-term memory (LSTM) may provide low forecasting errors, the prediction process needs to be modified for a blockchain-based LEM. This study stands out from previous research because it attempts to forecast the timeline of smart meters in general, rather than simply focusing on short-term energy forecasting. This is an important step in the development of more secure and cost-effective energy transactions and will pave the way for a more efficient and seamless energy market.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting Consumer Behavior and Preferences in E-Commerce Using Convolutional RNN Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Worldwide trade has been utterly transformed by the meteoric rise of the internet and the digital economy in the last 20 years. The effectiveness of advertising products and services online has been greatly improved by the rise of digital platforms, high-speed internet connections, and web technologies. More and more people are choosing to shop online instead than at physical stores. More and more people are buying online because they have high expectations for the convenience and security offered by online stores. Data preparation, feature selection, and training of the ConvRNN Model are presented in this study. Following the integration and purification of data during preprocessing, PCA is used to choose characteristics according to customer purchasing behaviour and preferences. The ConvRNN technique uses CNNs to track regional buying habits, and LSTMs to improve forecast accuracy by capturing long-term temporal correlations. This method was able to identify high-margin e-commerce opportunities by identifying crucial periods just before large stock performance variations. The 96.28% accuracy rate of the ConvRNN model is higher than that of conventional approaches. In order to improve inventory strategies, hone customer engagement, and enable data-informed market performance decisions, these studies show that AI-driven models can predict e-commerce consumer buying behaviour and preferences.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Characterizing Social Marketing Behavior of E-commerce Celebrities and Predicting Their Value</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of online social networks, marketing through online social platforms attracts a lot of attention. Recently, a special social marketing method is prevailing, i.e., e-commerce celebrities(ECs). ECs run their social network accounts to attract followers and then sell products to them directly. While the sales of ECs have dominated the e-commerce marketing in China, there is, however, a lack of accurate measurement and model about it. In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale cross-platform measurement on two of the biggest online social network platforms and e-commerce platforms in China, i.e., Sina Weibo and Taobao. We then characterize the typical behavioral patterns of ECs and build a machine learning model to quantitatively represent the relationship between the social network behavior and their product sale volumes. Experimental results show that we can accurately predict an EC's sale volume based on the 41 social network behavior features (F1 score can reach 0.83). Furthermore, we obtain the top-10 most important features that affect the sales. Our measurement and modeling results provide beneficial insights in understanding and optimizing social marketing for ECs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Simplex Social Spider Optimization with Decision Tree Consumer Behavior Patterns</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The population growth and the economic development are growing rapidly as a result of this makes more understanding the population behavior towards buying things. Understanding consumer behavior plays a major role for businesses in order to enhance the product quality and to provide a satisfactory product for consumers. The consumer behavior is considered in various factors based on age, their income, and their previous purchase history b considering all this factors a chart known as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is made in order to maintain all the details of the customers of that particular company. In this study we proposed Simplex Social Spider Optimization (SSSO)-Decision Tree of the consumer behavior. This technique uses each customer information as a spider web and splits the data based on the feature values. The results indicated that specific features, such as purchase frequency, average transaction value, and product preferences, significantly influenced customer classification outcomes. A decision tree is used for the classification of the consumer behavior. This enhances the predicting and classifying the customer's attitude while purchasing the products. This research highlights the potential of predictive analytics in tailoring marketing strategies and improving CRM. The proposed method have achieved the accuracy of 92.42 % The findings suggest that businesses can leverage these insights to optimize targeted promotions and enhance customer experience, ultimately driving sales and fostering brand loyalty.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An E-Commerce Product Feedback Review Using Sentimental Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Research in natural language processing and text mining has been active in this area for the past few years. Many companies are using a sentimental analysis approach to get feedback from customers. So, the main objective is to use the result of this analysis to understand and analyse the feedback given by the customers. A website will be used in this study to collect information for sentimental analysis where feedback has been taken from customers by using the website. After, customers fill out the feedback forms. The backend data of customers is stored in MySQL. Data from the website is stored as a CSV file and the CSV file is used to get the analysis result. In this way, an analysis can be done regarding the input given by users, whether they have given the right feedback, and if the product is valuable or not. In this way, an idea regarding customers' way of giving feedback can be analysed. The main challenge is collection of the data for the study. For analysis, many solutions use Naïve Bayes. The main disadvantage is that, here in naive bayes, an assumption has been made based on the probabilities of the logs. In the Naive Bayes rule, the position of words is not considered, so the sentiment cannot be predicted based on the context of a document. The goal of this study is to review previous studies of analysis and examine the best method to compare customer feedback.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Spatial Attention-Enhanced EEG Analysis for Profiling Consumer Choices</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Over the years, research in neuroscience-driven marketing has progressively delved into the conscious and subconscious behaviors of consumers. Existing Electroencephalography (EEG)-based studies related to consumer preferences toward products are not comprehensive. Due to non-stationarity issues of EEG, a significant variance is observed in inter-trial and inter-session EEG signals of a subject, which leads to challenges in building a universal consumer preference model across diverse subjects, sessions, and tasks. Transfer learning mitigates this challenge by utilizing data or knowledge from similar subjects, sessions, or tasks to improve the learning process for a new subject, session, or task, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Moreover, high-dimensional EEG features often lead to poor classification results. Therefore, selecting meaningful or refined features is of utmost importance for classification. Therefore, we propose a robust EEG-based neuromarketing framework combining deep transfer learning, spatial attention models, and deep neural networks. The proposed framework predicts the consumer choices (in terms of “likes” and “dislikes”) for e-commerce products. Initially, the knowledge distillation is performed from the pre-trained network to the proposed model, and the model is trained on the connectivity features of EEG. Next, the attention-based features are extracted from high-level connectivity features using the spatial attention model (Convolutional Block Attention Module: CBAM). CBAM extracts the attention feature maps along channel and spatial dimensions for adaptive feature refinement. The refined features improve the classification accuracy. Finally, the attention-based features are passed to the 2D CNN-based deep learning model to evaluate consumer choices. The proposed model achieves 95.60% classification accuracy with the experimental dataset. The proposed model achieves a significant improvement of 2.60% over the existing neuromarketing-based studies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Stream2Graph: Dynamic Knowledge Graph for Online Learning Applied in Large-scale Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Knowledge Graphs (KG) are valuable information sources that store knowledge in a domain (healthcare, finance, e-commerce, cyber-security.). Most industrial KGs are dynamic by nature as they are updated regularly with streaming data (customer activity, network traffic, application logs, IT process). However, extracting insights from continuously updated data comes with major challenges, particularly in big data settings. In this paper, we address the following challenges: 1) ingesting heterogeneous data, 2) training and deployment of predictive models on continuously evolving data, and 3) implementation of data pipelines for updating and maintaining the KG in production. We cover multiple aspects of this process, from knowledge collection to its operationalization. We propose Stream2Graph, a stream-based system for building and updating the knowledge base dynamically in real time. Then we show how graph features can be used in downstream online machine learning models. The solution speeds up big data stream learning and knowledge extraction to enhance Graph-based AI applications. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our solution for knowledge base construction and improvement of big data learning capabilities. Using data from Stream2Graph resulted in speedups for training and inference time in the range from 547x to 2000x in downstream ML models. Finally, we provide the lessons learned from applying graph-based online learning on large-scale network processing high-velocity streaming data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>NLP-Based Recommendation Approach for Diverse Service Generation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this study, we examine the potential of language models for natural language processing (NLP)-based recommendations, with a distinct focus on predicting users’ next product purchases based on their prior purchasing patterns. Our model specifically harnesses tokenized rather than complete product names for learning. This granularity allows for a refined understanding of the interrelations among different products. For instance, items like ‘Chocolate Milk’ and ‘Coffee Milk’ find linkage through the shared token ‘Milk.’ Additionally, we explored the impact of various n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) in tokenization to further refine our understanding of product relationships and recommendation efficacy. This nuanced method paves the way for generating product names that might not exist in current retail settings, exemplified by concoctions like ‘Coffee Chocolate Milk.’ Such potential offerings can provide retailers with fresh product brainstorming opportunities. Furthermore, scrutiny of the frequency of these generated product name tokens can reveal prospective trends in purchasing keywords. This facilitates enterprises in creative brainstorming of novel products and swiftly responding to the dynamic demands and trends of consumers. The datasets used in this study come from UK e-Commerce and Instacart Data, comprising 71,205 and 166,440 rows, respectively. This investigation juxtaposes the NLP-based recommendation model, which employs tokenization, with its non-tokenized counterpart, leveraging Hit-Rate and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) as evaluative benchmarks. The outcomes distinctly favor the tokenized NLP-based recommendation model across all evaluated metrics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Is AI and Digitization New Avatar for Air Freighters and Forwarders</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>General observation points out that Start-Ups normally dominate Technology Disruption as they are constantly looking for those left out segments of markets, which have been overlooked by established players. This phenomenon can be currently seen in the crowded airfreight industry where start-up AI companies are promising air freighters with productivity efficiency and enhancement because of rising costs. AI start Ups are also offering services like major upcoming mega-events so that freighter and airlines can tap potential customers and relevant stakeholders for revenue and bottom-line enhancement. The airlines are also attracted to such AI start Ups, because of the IATA forecast for the current fiscal year, &quot;a decline in global profits for airlines&quot;. As per IATA, overall profits are set to decline by 7% to $28 billion in the year 2020. Today AI is even promising to make inroads in a spectrum of operations areas, like targeted advertising, aircraft maintenance offering relative demand comparison services to airlines. The net result of these is benefits for freighter and carriers who change their offering, after looking at the high demand for freight or focus on filling seats at lower prices when they know there will be slower periods for passenger seats and lean demand for the freight sector. Airlines and freighters whose portfolios have significant dependence on freight are turning towards research based AI tools rather than gazing at crystal ball or sky gazing through spreadsheet matching events versus their offerings. AI startups have also started making inroads on one hand in providing insights to airlines on high-value cargo, and other hand promising passengers with lucrative benefits of alternative flights to accommodate cargo's weight. Further service experienced by B2C (which is raised by Online Retailing Co. like Amazon, Flipkart) is now has a domino effect on B2B organizations especially for freight forwarders who are looking for data to raise their standard bars. This exploratory paper draws data from literature and secondary sources to drive the point that how AI is making inroads on the freight and cargo industry of the future. It also paints a realistic picture of the future of these industries</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Decoding Sentiments in Product Reviews: A Smart Analysis Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recently, sentiment analysis has been the backbone for understanding public opinions and behaviors, especially for online reviews on products. In this paper, a classification of product reviews based on the machine learning approach is taken. The study preprocesses text data using tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization on a data set from Kaggle, where the data is down-sampled to 70,000 reviews. A voting ensemble classifier comprising Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented to harness the power of more than one algorithm. Through this experiment, the proposed model demonstrated robustness to fit nuanced sentiment patterns in reviews, mainly achieving an accuracy of 85.75%. This work extends existing methods by combining ensemble learning with text-based feature extraction using TF-IDF for a good computational tradeoff in predictive accuracy. The findings echo the increasing need for scalable, accurate sentiment classification models in e-commerce analysis and social media analysis. However, while these advancements of large-scale pre-trained language models has received attention, challenges such as the cultural context interpretation, sarcasm detection and processing the multilingual reviews persist. This work lays the groundwork for future research that will overcome these challenges and enable greater consumer sentiment analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Item Cold Start in E-Commerce Recommender Systems: A Survey</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender systems in e-commerce face a persistent challenge known as the item cold-start problem, where systems struggle to make relevant suggestions about new items due to insufficient historical data. While early research primarily focused on effectiveness metrics like accuracy, recent years have seen a change toward incorporating fairness and explainability into the systems. The evolution of transformer architectures has significantly impacted data complexity. This also marks a shift enabling systems to power recommendations on complex patterns in data, but with a requirement of larger datasets. This survey categorizes existing approaches to the item cold-start problem using a three-tier classification system that distinguishes methodological foundation, data structure and implementation technique and presents them in a temporal framework that highlights both data complexity and underlying objectives. The survey outlines a practical framework tailored to different e-commerce business scales, guiding implementation strategies accordingly. Additionally, evaluation metrics are analyzed through the lens of effectiveness and fairness, providing practitioners with a comprehensive guide for implementing these systems in practice.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Opinion Mining based Fake Product review Monitoring and Removal System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Fake review detection and its elimination from the given dataset using different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is important in several aspects. In this article, the fake review dataset is trained by applying two different Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the accuracy of how genuine are the reviews in a given dataset. The rate of fake reviews in E-commerce industry and even other platforms is increasing when depend on product reviews for the item found online on different websites and applications. The products of the company were trusted before making a purchase. So this fake review problem must be addressed so that these large E-commerce industries such as Flipkart, Amazon, etc. can rectify this issue so that the fake reviewers and spammers are eliminated to prevent users from losing trust on online shopping platforms. This model can be used by websites and applications with few thousands of users where it can predict the authenticity of the review based on which the website owners can take necessary action towards them. This model is developed using Naïve Bayes and random forest methods. By applying these models one can know the number of spam reviews on a website or application instantly. To counter such spammers, a sophisticated model is required in which a need to be trained on millions of reviews. In this work “amazon Yelp dataset” is used to train the models and its very small dataset is used for training on a very small scale and can be scaled to get high accuracy and flexibility.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Market Basket Analysis using A-Priori Algorithm and FP-Tree Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Market Basket Analysis is used for many applications like online marketing, recommendation engines, information security, etc. Over the past few years, it has been one of the hot topics among research groups as its widely used e-commerce site to recommend related products or arrangements of layouts on the basis of frequently purchased items in supermarkets and fixing consumer index price as per consumer’s demands. In this paper, we have focused on two widely used market basket analysis algorithms i.e. Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm. This paper mainly compares these two algorithms and compares the efficiency on the basis of database sizes, time complexity and space complexity. As a finding of comparison of these two algorithms we discovered that the Apriori algorithm required more time complexity while Fp-growth required more space complexity. Apriori algorithm can be used when there are no time constraints but low space available whereas FP-growth Algorithm used for low time constraint as it uses tree repeatedly to add new types of transactions to reduce time complexity.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendations to Increase the Customer Interaction of E-commerce Applications with Web Usage Mining</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Web mining uses data mining methods to extract knowledge from web applications. It is used in e-commerce to track client browsing behavior. The issue with e-commerce is that we only know about our customers once they place an order. The primary goal of this endeavor is to identify a viable option to continue operating a profitable online store by better understanding customers. The research project aims to identify customer preferences and purchase behaviors so that improvements can be made to e-commerce platforms based on these findings. Web usage mining enables the seller to monitor, investigate, and identify patterns from compiled data to create a fundamental statistical foundation for decision-making. To properly use web usage mining, it is necessary to collect qualitative visitor data, which enables researchers to determine whether a visitor has viewed a product repeatedly, added it to their wishlist before making a purchase, or bought it during a particular season, etc. A limited number of publications were found in this domain, and most of the work was done with limited data like user clicks, navigation paths, etc. In this research, event listeners have been added to the e-commerce application to capture user actions and behavior towards a specific product on the application. Four classification algorithms experimented with the event data and identified the most effective algorithm to develop the prediction model. Users’ purchasing patterns and buying behaviors were analyzed and identified using the model developed with the Random Forest classification algorithm. Recommendations for the e-commerce applications were developed according to the identified user behavior and purchasing patterns. This strategy will lead the ecommerce industry to a profitable economic point by increasing the effectiveness of the application.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Power of Session-Level Data: Predicting Return Intent Along the Browsing Journey</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Despite the growing challenge of product returns in e-commerce, limited research explores real-time prediction of return intent. Existing studies typically rely on customer relationship management (CRM) data and require historical context, such as a user's return behavior the last n orders. However, many online shoppers lack this context, because they either browse as guests and can thus not be identified in realtime or are first-time visitors. This reduces the accuracy and coverage of existing return intent assessment methods, which would otherwise lay the groundwork for timely interventions. This paper explores the potential for return prediction based only on browsing behavior using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. We simulate real-world settings by training and testing on a rolling-window approach on logged browsing data. We find for our model to attain \mathrmF 1=0.68 and ROC AUC = 0.70 on average. Furthermore, our model demonstrates superior accuracy compared to methods relying on CRM data without historical user context. A subsequent analysis of the important features, based on the trained LSTM model, draws insights into which browsing behaviors may be early warning signals indicating return. For instance, having a high number of items in the shopping cart from a previous browsing session is strongly associated with high-value returns. Meanwhile, for desktop users, the use of filters appears to be a driving indicator for returns. In a hypothetical calculation, we illustrate the positive economic impact our approach enables to e-commerce companies. Our findings highlight the potential of utilizing browsing behavior for prediction of return intent, providing a foundation for developing real-time return intent assessment strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unlocking Strategic Insights: A Machine Learning Approach to Business Management Optimization</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the field of corporate management, the optimization of strategies stands as a critical attempt to traverse the intricacies of the current marketplace. Despite developments in technology, gaps continue in successfully employing data-driven techniques for strategic decision-making. Ad-dressing this difficulty, our study intends to fill current research gaps by evaluating the potential of machine learning algorithms for company management optimization. Through the use of LSTM, Random Forest, and K-means clustering algorithms, we evaluate a complete dataset covering sales transactions and client profiles. Notably, our results demonstrate the Random Forest model's remarkable performance, obtaining an accuracy of 0.92 and an F1-score of 0.91, under-scoring its usefulness in predictive analytics. By combining theoretical insights with practical applications, our research helps expand approaches for strategic optimization in real-world corporate situations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>4 Augmented reality in cross-domain applications</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A comparatively recent but rapidly growing field there at convergence of pattern recognition and visual effects, augmented reality (AR) has a wide range of uses ranging from gameplay and amusement to healthcare and educational settings. Although it has existed for almost half a century, the scientific world has recently shown a substantial amount of interest in it. In this, we focus on the cross-domain applications of AR and efforts are put forward to bring out the key features of the same. Currently, the capability of AR and digital twins (DT) has started to emerge, sparking an increase in ongoing research from both academia and business. Another area of research which is receiving high focus is advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). ADAS are utilized on every level from forecasting the weather to security, regardless of the fact that the machine is operating the vehicle. Such cutting-edge ADASs employ a variety of aids for motorists to ensure the safety of the voyage; such complex aids send out early indications of a variety of situations, including such changes in the road’s state, potential traffic congestion, and severe weather. We also propose a method of AR-assisted ADAS by which the road accidents can be reduced.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multi-Stage Vehicle Dispatch for Community Group-buying Logistics via Deep Reinforcement Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Community group-buying is an emerging shopping model in which individuals within the same community collectively purchase daily necessities at lower prices. The logistics transportation in this scenario requires higher turnover rates and timeliness compared to traditional online shopping. Therefore, making efficient vehicle dispatch decisions is necessary to improve delivery efficiency and reduce transportation costs. However, uncertainties in orders and complex dependencies between multi-stage decisions in the community group-buying scenario challenge the scheduling of delivery vehicles. In this paper, we propose a vehicle dispatch system for community group-buying logistics based on a predict-then-optimize process, which incorporates a demand prediction module and a vehicle dispatch module. In the prediction module, we categorize goods and predict the total quantity of each category using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). In the vehicle dispatch module, we model the vehicle dispatch process as a reinforcement learning problem and use an action masking mechanism to prune the policy search space. Experimental results demonstrate that the vehicle dispatch system achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to several popular baselines across three different datasets. Our system reduces transportation costs by at least 8.89% and improves decision efficiency by at least 10%. Moreover, it behaves close to the approximate optimal solution in most cases.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Application of Machine Learning in Precision Agriculture using IoT</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The demand for food has been increasing over the past six decades with the global population increase. Scientists have been finding different ways to meet this demand, such as; green revolution and genetically modified crop methods. These involve an unnatural technique to increase the yield, such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and modified seeds; these might be beneficial in the short term but might slowly disturb the internal body mechanism. In recent years, consumers are becoming more concerned about their food intake and prefer food with no adulteration and harmful pesticides. This has brought in the hype for a subdivision of framing, organic farming, where organic fertilizers and pesticides are used to retain the quality and nutrition values of the crop bring harvested. In organic farming, the right crop must be chosen according to the soil type and climate. This reduces the chance of pre-harvest crop losses caused by the abiotic stress in the environment, such as the soil pH levels, improper irrigation, climate, and temperature. However, when the desired conditions are provided to the crop, we can reduce the pre-harvest loss up to 35%. This paper offers a practical approach to reduce this loss by predicting what crop can be planted according to the present soil conditions and climate to prevent pre-harvest losses. The model involves a temperature and humidity sensor, a soil moisture sensor, a soil pH sensor, IoT, and a water pump under a greenhouse environment connected with the help of a development board, Raspberry pi, and machine learning techniques.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Flexibility - enabling technologies using electric vehicles</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Electric car usage has been growing rapidly over the past ten years, cars stock in 2018 exceeded 5 millions, +63% from 2019, Europe is accounting for 24% of the global fleet. The request of fast, rapid and ultra rapid charge is, on the other side, posing electric power network challenges. In this scenario the DSO is interested in exploiting EV charges in terms of flexibility that can be planned in optimized way, especially when it is combined with high penetration of RES. This paper provides evidence that EVs charging sessions, planned using a dedicated forecasting module, can contribute to balance the distribution power network; for this purpose suitable flexibility-enabling technologies developed under the H2020 project SOFIE have been used. Data analysis has pointed out that a proper program of charging sessions could significantly increase self-consumption index; moreover, an optimal scheduling has been validated taking into account realistic constraints for its actual implementation. Finally, the paper shows how the enabling technologies for flexibility exploitation have been implemented and validated; notably, a rescheduling of the charging sessions is allowed through the usage of forecasting techniques as well as the implementation of blockchain technologies for enabling a flexibility marketplace.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Review of the Literature on the Effects of Big Data and Machine Learning on Digital Transformation in Marketing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this in-depth investigation is to investigate the considerable influence that machine learning (ML) and big data have had on the digital transformation that has occurred in the marketplace. Conventional, intuition-based marketing is being replaced by data-driven strategies that make use of real-time analytics and predictive modelling to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. This paper reviews a variety of studies to demonstrate how these methods are replacing traditional marketing. Personalized marketing, dynamic strategy adjustments, and deeper customer behaviors insights have all become available as a result of the integration of these technologies, despite the fact that technology has also brought forth severe ethical and privacy concerns. It is discussed in the assessment that it is necessary to find a middle ground between taking into consideration these ethical concerns and making use of big data in order to achieve a competitive advantage. When everything is taken into consideration, the findings shed light on the revolutionary potential of Big Data and machine learning in marketing. They also advocate for responsible data governance and a paradigm shift towards methodologies that are more flexible, effective, and customer-focused.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Deep Text Mining-Based Cosmetics Consumer Sentiment Analysis Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of e-commerce, consumer reviews have become crucial channels for businesses to obtain market insights and user feedback. In this study, we propose a sentiment analysis method based on deep text mining, targeting cosmetic product reviews from the JD.com platform. Firstly, comments are preprocessed using Jieba segmentation and TF-IDF feature extraction combined with N -gram models, along with class-weight adjustment to address class imbalance. Experiments involve traditional machine learning methods, with Logistic Regression achieving an initial class- 0 F1-score of 0.8135. We further compare the influence of different stopword strategies, including generic stopwords, Chinese sentiment-specific stopwords, and a customized stopword list constructed based on word frequency and N-gram analysis. Results show the updated stopword list performs similarly to not using any stopwords in Random Forest. Additionally, deep learning models (LSTM and CNN) achieve initial class-0 F1-scores of 0.8331 and 0.8271, respectively, improving to 0.8598 and 0.8521 after Bayesian optimization, while Logistic Regression slightly improves to \mathbf0. 8 1 3 9. Overall, results indicate that TF-IDF text representation combined with deep learning and Bayesian optimization significantly improves negative sentiment prediction, offering valuable insights for future large-scale, cross-domain sentiment analysis research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Hybrid ResNet-ViT Architecture for Multi-Attribute Prediction in Product Image Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Accurately identifying the characteristics of products from supplier uploaded photos during cataloguing is essential for any e-commerce platform. Most merchants and suppliers in these platforms, particularly those with limited resources, have difficulty manually entering all the information. This procedure is sluggish, laborious, and susceptible to errors, as evident from a quick review of any e-commerce platform catalog where for instance, an image may show a short-sleeved garment while the description incorrectly states it is long-sleeved. Such inconsistencies can result in client frustration and ambiguity over the purchases. This paper proposes a solution to the issue with a hybrid model that integrates the ResNet101 and ViT model, which is then trained using the stacked ensemble learning approach to predict product features directly from images. The model’s average accuracy is 0.8548, precision is 0.7946, recall is 0.7137, and F1 score is 0.7247. The findings indicate that this attribute prediction model can enhance catalogue accuracy, save human labour, and elevate consumer experience, in real-world environments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Building a Recommendation System of Consumers' Preferable Choice Using a Collaborative-Filtering</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, one of many challenges in e-Commerce is to target the right customer by recommending relevant products or services that suit their preference. To overcome this challenge, various sources have been utilised including customer comments and reviews from social media to analyse their preference based on their interests and sharing. Numerous large e-Commerce web sites are now investing in recommender systems to ease their customers into recommending the relevant products that suit their preferences. However, there are still limitations within the existing recommender systems that are lacking in discovering the real sentiment values of how customers perceived the products or services offered. This study aims to develop a product recommender system that incorporates the sentiment values from customer post on social media and predict the top five recommended products using the Collaborative-Based filtering technique. The tweets were collected from top global and local retailers, Amazon and Shopee to understand the customer response from social media followed by the development of a recommender system for the customer. The findings of this study highlighted a total of 8 clusters such as electronics, entertainment, and books from the clustering experiment. The top 5 best seller product predictions for each category also showed a score of 0.59, which is higher than the threshold score in the evaluation stage.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Text Preprocessing Impact for Sentiment Classification in Product Review</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the Covid-19 pandemic situation, the e-commerce platform has significant data of product reviews in real-time. Businesses need rating and review systems to immediately expose their consumers' feelings about their products and services and use every volume of data to strengthen their competitive strategies. Amazon is one platform that can provide a vast quantity of product review data. Unfortunately, data from product reviews are typically unstructured and unmanageable. Therefore, this experimental study observed text preprocessing impact to process unstructured product review data using sentiment classifier Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with better accuracy. The SVM performed higher evaluation model performance, with an accuracy of 88,13%, but the Naïve Bayes classifier has minimum execution time. Furthermore, the experimental result using our approach TF-IDF for feature extraction may significantly improve classification accuracy. As a result, our approach reveals that a good text preprocessing sequence is critical to the classifier's prediction performance for unstructured product review data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Content (Item)‐Based Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summary The main idea behind Content‐Based Recommendation System is to recommend an item to a customer similar to the previous items that are rated high by the same customer. Initially, we create an item profile based on the ratings provided by the user for the items he purchased, videos/movies watched, books (textual contents) read, music/songs heard etc.. The user profile captures information like frequently purchased products/brands, type of movies watched (with a specific actor/director/genre etc…), type of music listened (melody/beat etc…) and type of books read (comic/positive thinking etc…) by the particular user. The item profile will be represented as a Boolean vector based on the features of interest for a given user. The item profile will be created for all the items rated by a specific user. From, the item profile we infer the user profile. A simple way to create user profile is to take the average rating given by the user for a specific item. There are also several other ways of creating user profiles which we will discuss in this chapter in detail. Basically, the user profile captures the details of items which are likeable by a particular user. Once the user profile is created, given a new item that is not rated by the user which may be a product/movie/song/book etc.…, it can be represented as a Boolean vector and this Boolean vector shall be compared with Boolean vector corresponding to the user profile using techniques like cosine similarity and if the cosine similarity is above a particular threshold the item may be recommended for the user. We shall discuss the various methods to recommend item based on contents in this chapter.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Joint Reason Generation and Rating Prediction for Explainable Recommendation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Most recommendation systems focus on predicting rating or finding aspect information in reviews to understand user preferences and item properties. However, these methods ignore the effectiveness and persuasiveness of recommendation results. Consequently, explainable recommendation, namely providing recommendation results with recommendation reasons at the same time, has attracted increasing attention of researchers due to its ability in fostering transparency and trust. It is lucky that some E-commerce websites provide a kind of new interaction box called Tips and users can express their comments on items with a simple sentence. This brings us an opportunity to realize explainable recommendation. Under the supervision of two explicit feedbacks, namely rating and textual tips, we can implement a multi-task learning model which can provide recommendation results and generate recommendation reasons at the same time. In this paper, we propose an Encoder-Decoder and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) based Explainable Recommendation model named EMER to simultaneously implement reason generation and rating prediction. Item’s title contains significant product-related information and plays an important role in grabbing user’s attention, so we fuse it in our model to generate recommendation reasons. Numerous experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model is superior to the state-of-the-art models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Prediction of Clients Based on Google Analytics Income Using Support Vector Machines</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study aims to deploy Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify clients within the user base of the IMOLKO company website, predicated on the analysis of clickstream behavior. The study conducted several experiments using Monte Carlo cross-validation, encompassing diverse training and testing data proportions. Model performance was evaluated using parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1 score. The results indicate that the SVMs consistently performs well across multiple runs, as evidenced by the low standard deviations associated with the evaluation metrics. It suggests that the results are reliable and not strongly influenced by random variations. The findings indicate that SVMs is an acceptable classification technique for predicting client status in the context of IMOLKO C.A. However, it is worth noting that although the model effectively predicts non-customers, the possibility of false positives exists, which reduces the percentage of F1 scores. The imbalance in the database, with a significantly higher number of non-clients compared to clients, may be impacting the method’s efficiency. A balanced database, where each class has a similar number of examples, is desirable in classification tasks to avoid biases towards a dominant client class and ensure accurate decisions for all client classes. In conclusion, SVMs show promise as a reliable classification technique for predicting client status in the IMOLKO C.A. context. However, addressing database imbalance and conducting further research are imperative to enhance the performance of the models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Multi-Objective Optimization Model for Single-Product and Multi-Warehouse Based On NSGA-II</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The increasing complexity of modern supply chains has amplified the challenges of warehouse allocation in e-commerce, where decision-makers must balance trade-offs between rental costs, warehouse utilization, and operational efficiency. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model based on the NSGA-II algorithm, which incorporates key factors such as product category correlations, rental costs, warehouse utilization, and category distribution. Unlike traditional models, this approach allows each product category to be stored in up to three warehouses, providing greater flexibility and adaptability. Experimental results using real-world data demonstrate the model's capability to generate Pareto-optimal solutions, effectively addressing conflicting objectives and offering practical, balanced, and flexible strategies for warehouse allocation. This study provides decision-makers with an advanced tool to optimize warehouse management in diverse and dynamic scenarios..</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Representation Learning of Tangled Key-Value Sequence Data for Early Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Key-value sequence data has become ubiquitous and naturally appears in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from the user-product purchasing sequences in e-commerce, to network packet sequences forwarded by routers in networking. Classifying these key-value sequences is important in many scenarios such as user profiling and malicious applications identification. In many time-sensitive scenarios, besides the requirement of classifying a key-value sequence accurately, it is also desired to classify a key-value sequence early, in order to respond fast. However, these two goals are conflicting in nature, and it is challenging to achieve them simultaneously. In this work, we formulate a novel tangled key-value sequence early classification problem, where a tangled key-value sequence is a mixture of several concurrent key-value sequences with different keys. The goal is to classify each individual key-value sequence sharing a same key both accurately and early. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, i.e., Key-Value sequence Early Co-classification (KVEC), which leverages both inner- and inter-correlations of items in a tangled key-value sequence through key correlation and value correlation to learn a better sequence representation. Meanwhile, a time-aware halting policy decides when to stop the ongoing key-value sequence and classify it based on current sequence representation. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines significantly. KVEC improves the prediction accuracy by up to 4.7 -17.5% under the same prediction earliness condition, and improves the harmonic mean of accuracy and earliness by up to 3.7 -14.0%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Segmenting Online Shoppers: A Combined Cluster and Logistic Regression Approach for Forecasting Purchase Behavior</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper examines customers’ online shopping behavior and its relationship to purchase decisions. There are two research questions for the paper: 1) How can marketers segment prior customers’ online shopping behavior to develop a more accurate consumer segmentation for forecasting purchase behavior? 2) Which factors influence customers’ online shopping behavior? The analysis used a dataset of 12,330 samples with ten continuous and eight categorical variables. Cluster and logistic regression analyses were conducted on the dataset. Cluster analysis grouped customers by operating system, browser, location, and traffic type, while logistic regression estimated online customers’ purchase intentions. The results show that different factors influence various customer segments. In Group 1, administrative factors, product-related duration, exit rate, and page value significantly affect purchase behavior. In Group 2, product-related factors, exit rate, page value, and special days play an important role. In Group 3, product-related factors, bounce rate, page value, and visitor type are key factors. This paper contributes by using cluster analysis and logistic regression to segment online customer usage behavior and forecast purchase behavior. It evaluates key predictors of online shopping behavior that differ across customer groups, supporting targeted marketing strategies and decision-making.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unifying Technologies in Industry 4.0</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summary Industry 4.0 refers to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which involves the integration of different technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and blockchain. These technologies work together to create a smart and connected ecosystem that enhances industrial processes and improves overall efficiency. IoT is a network of physical devices that are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity to enable them to collect and exchange data. In Industry 4.0, IoT plays a critical role in enabling machines and devices to communicate with each other and share data in real time. This data can then be used to optimize production processes and reduce downtime, leading to cost savings and increased productivity. Big data analytics is another important technology that is used in Industry 4.0. It involves the use of advanced algorithms to analyze large volumes of data and extract insights that can be used to improve decision‐making. In an industrial setting, big data analytics can be used to optimize production processes, predict maintenance needs, and improve product quality. AR and VR are technologies that allow users to interact with digital information in a physical environment. In Industry 4.0, AR and VR can be used to enhance the training of employees, provide virtual simulations of production processes, and enable remote collaboration between teams. These technologies can also be used to visualize and analyze data, allowing users to gain a better understanding of complex systems and processes. Finally, blockchain technology is an emerging technology that is being used in Industry 4.0 to improve supply chain transparency, traceability, and efficiency. Blockchain technology enables secure and transparent sharing of data between different parties, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud and errors. This technology is particularly useful in industries where the provenance and authenticity of products are critical, such as the food and pharmaceutical industries.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Aggregating Customer Review Attributes for Online Reputation Generation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we face the problem of generating reputation for movies, products, hotels, restaurants and services by mining customer reviews expressed in natural language. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies on reputation generation for online entities have primarily examined semantic and sentiment orientation of customer reviews, disregarding other useful information that could be extracted from reviews, such as review helpfulness and review time. Therefore, we propose a new approach that combines review helpfulness, review time, review attached rating and review sentiment orientation for the purpose of generating a single reputation value toward various entities. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we design two equations to compute review helpfulness and review time scores, and we fine-tune Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to predict the review sentiment orientation probability. Second, we design a formula to assign a numerical score to each review. Then, we propose a new formula to compute reputation value toward the target entity (movie, product, hotel, restaurant, service, etc). Finally, we propose a new form to visualize reputation that depicts numerical reputation value, opinion categories, top positive review and top negative review. Experimental results coming from several real-world data sets of miscellaneous domains collected from IMDb, TripAdvisor and Amazon websites show the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating and visualizing reputation compared to three state-of-the-art reputation systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Challenges and Perspectives of Recommender Systems in Vending Machines</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This paper describes the features of using recommendation algorithms for vending machines. A vending machine is an automated machine with a significantly limited range of products (snacks, beverages, cigarettes), and it also does not provide any additional information about the customer, which imposes some limitations on the predicting relevant products. In order to increase the demand for vending products and make a profit, this paper proposes to consider how modern recommendation algorithms can be applied in this area. One of the important stages in building recommendation system is preparing data for analysis, so this paper describes an approach for grouping data by sales intensity and also considers the set cover problem.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Shopping Cart Analysis Using Apriori Algorithm and Association Rules</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Machine learning and artificial intelligence have many applications in today’s world. Computers can process large amounts of data very quickly. One of the applications of big data analysis is data mining. Shopping cart analysis is a data-only technique that retailers use to better understand shoppers and increase sales. Shopping cart analysis is a powerful tool for retailers because it allows them to understand the purchasing behavior of customers and create strategies to increase sales and customer loyalty. Association rules are used in shopping cart analysis to predict the probability of two products being purchased together. The point is, they create or organize the right mining, it is the basis of the work basket analysis. We found that the Apriori algorithm is 100 times faster than the current Apriori implementation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Cross-Domain Disentangled Learning for E-Commerce Live Streaming Recommendation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce live streaming as an increasingly popular sales model has generated a significant amount of gross merchandise value (GMV) for e-commerce platforms. Live streaming recommendation systems (LSRS) of e-commerce aim to recommend the most appropriate live channels for users to motivate them to buy products. Existing LSRS methods focus only on the user’s interaction behaviors on the live channel (live domain) while ignoring the user’s behaviors and intentions on the e-commerce product (product domain). As a result, the user’s consistent purchase intentions in the cross-domain are not being fully captured, especially when user present differentiated purchase intentions in the cross-domain. How to disentangle user’s consistent intentions and domain-specific intentions in the cross-domain poses a challenge to the LSRS of e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we present a live channel recommendation method, named eLiveRec, developed for Taobao, one of the largest e-commerce platform in the world. Specifically, eLiveRec employs the disentangled encoder module to learn user’s cross-domain consistent intentions and domain-specific intentions. Then, an adaptive multi-task learning framework is developed to jointly optimize the multiple objectives (e.g., stay time, click goods bag, and click products after entering channel) related to live streaming recommendation. In this way, the performance of live streaming recommendation can be further improved and con-form to standard industry RS paradigms. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large-scale industry dataset collected from Taobao Live platform have been performed. Both online and offline experimental results indicate that eLiveRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>E-Commerce Personalized Recommendation System in Big Data Based on Three-Way Concept Lattices</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The e-commerce recommendation system can automatically judge the preferences of users according to the browsing situation, and recommend relevant products to customers based on this basis to reduce the time wasted by customers in looking for products. The e-commerce recommendation system is to use the e-commerce big data platform to provide consumers with product information and relevant suggestions, to recommend consumers to buy their favorite types of products, and to imitate the salesman to help consumers to complete the purchase behavior. The paper presents e-commerce personalized recommendation system in big data based on three-way concept lattices. Finally, the method experimentally proves that the proposed method achieves accurate personalized recommendation results and showing better prediction accuracy, which has strong scalability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sentiment-Based Insights Into Amazon Musical Instrument Purchases</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The project aims to analyze Amazon music instrument reviews to understand customer satisfaction in terms of key sentiments related to the products. Online shopping has made customer reviews increasingly relevant for both buyers and sellers. The project analyzes unprocessed text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP), which includes steps like text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. Word embeddings or term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) are used to encode the large dataset. A method of sentiment analysis on user reviews is described, with the dataset going through preliminary NLP work. Sentiments are classified using various models, evaluated based on accuracy, cross-validation scores, and classification reports. Visualization graphics depict sentiment distribution, emphasizing the potential of NLP for better sentiment analysis performance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Image-based Measuring Technique for the Prediction of Human Body Size</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>To achieve high prediction accuracy of human body keeps an open issue for decades of years, especially when COVID comes and online retail becomes the major consumption channels. The body measurement is the key to solve cloth matching and recommendation in clothing e-commerce. This paper proposes a practical framework of image-based body measurement, by only taking the user's front and side photos. This framework does not require pure background or precise standing position, and supports manual modification of the measurement results. The framework takes people's height, weight and gender as params to initialize a common body size set, and corrects each part of the set by analyzing the body proportion via the front and side images. The prediction accuracy was tested with the 50 digital models and 10 real people. Results showed that the circumference sizes such as chest, waist, hips, have errors less then 5%, while the length sizes such as arm, leg approach to actual length on net body models. For real people, the errors depend on the wearing clothes. In addition to high accuracy, the method has a rapid process speed, reaching 19QPS on a NVIDIA RTX5000 GPU server.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>CoD: Coherent Detection of Entities from Images with Multiple Modalities</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Object detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision, whose research has primarily focused on unimodal models, solely operating on visual data. However, in many real-world applications, data from multiple modalities may be available, such as text accompanying the visual data. Leveraging traditional models on these multi-modal data sources may lead to difficulties in accurately delineating object boundaries. For example, in a document containing a combination of text and images, the model must encompass the images and texts pertaining to the same object in a single bounding box. To address this, we propose a model that takes in multi-scale image features, text extracted through OCR, and 2D positional embeddings of words as inputs, and returns bounding boxes that incorporate the image and associated description as single entities. Furthermore, to address the challenge posed by the irregular arrangement of images and their corresponding textual descriptions, we propose the concept of a “Negative Product Bounding Box” (PBB). This box encapsulates instances where the model faces confusion and tends to predict incorrect bounding boxes. To enhance the model’s performance, we incorporate these negative boxes into the loss function governing matching and classification. Additionally, a domain adaptation model is proposed to handle scenarios involving a domain gap between training and test samples. In order to assess the effectiveness of our model, we construct a multimodal dataset comprising product descriptions from online retailers’ catalogs. On this dataset, our proposed model demonstrates significant improvements of 27.2%, 4.3%, and 1.7% in handling hard negative samples, multi-modal input, and domain shift scenarios, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Consumer Rating Analysis and Recommendation Methodology Using Machine Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the era of online shopping, Online platforms are loaded with online shopping. Nowadays, online shopping has become a trend and a necessity of fast delivery to home. Online platforms sites like Twitter, in this new time, is stacked with product marketing and feedback information. One of the most broadly utilized miniatures writing for a blog webpage, Twitter, is the place where individuals share their thoughts as tweets and thusly it becomes perhaps the best hotspot for nostalgic investigation of feedback of products. Assessments can be generally assembled into three classifications for positive, negative and neutral and the method involved with dissecting contrasts of conclusions and gathering them in this large number of classes is done by data modeling. Data mining is fundamentally utilized to uncover applicable data from tweets information particularly from the informal communication destinations. A Model is also designed with Micro blogging solution for the evaluation of reviews. In many social sites there are many online marketing recommendation may be done with recommendation post from the product consumer which would initiate the growth of any business and also eliminate the need of any raw data for analysis of the consumer rating. In the model, we propose a methodology two methodology, one is analysis from social sites like Facebook and other social platform and another is recommendation method which decrease the marketing strategy required for the consumer to consumer connection. A testing recommendation helps to remove not required information from the product consumer to product consumer communication and this helps for the product recommendation analysis to be done properly.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>OntoCommerce: Incorporating Ontology and Sequential Pattern Mining for Personalized E-Commerce Recommendations</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The abundance of information on online purchasing websites makes it challenging for customers to locate products that match their preferences. However, the cold-start problem arises when there isn’t enough previous data, making it harder to make accurate recommendations for new customers or products. The enormous number of possible customers and products in a recommendation system leads to sparse data, which makes it harder to generate relevant recommendations and causes the sparsity problem. In addition, existing e-commerce recommender systems have difficulty making accurate product recommendations because they disregard individual consumer characteristics. In order to overcome these limitations, a hybrid recommender system combining ontology and sequential pattern mining (SPM) techniques is proposed. The strategy entails constructing an ontology that encompasses customer and product-related knowledge in the e-commerce domain. This ontology is then utilized to calculate customer preference similarities and generate predictions for the intended customer. The SPM algorithm is applied to the results of collaborative filtering to generate personalized recommendations for the customer. Experiments have demonstrated that the hybrid recommender system outperforms existing methods and resolves the cold-start problem and data sparsity in e-commerce recommender systems effectively. Even with limited initial data, the system generates accurate and individualized recommendations based on ontological domain knowledge and the customer’s sequential purchase patterns. By integrating ontology and sequential pattern mining, this strategy enhances the precision and individualization of the e-commerce industry’s recommendation process.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Empirical evaluation of Amazon fine food reviews using Text Mining</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Approximately 1.6 million individuals use the e-commerce website “amazon” to buy things from a variety of categories, including food. Reviewing products by consumers who have already purchased them is beneficial to those who are considering doing so, however reviews can be either positive or negative. The buyer finds it difficult to read through such many evaluations before making a purchase, but machine learning ideas and training models make it possible. Our objective is to categorize the reviews based on the attributes that are present in the dataset in order to address issues like these. Redundancy is present in data when it is presented to us in its raw form. So, since evaluations with a score of 3 are regarded as impartial, we delete them along with redundancy. After that, we use the NLP tool kit (a column in the data set) to preprocess the text by removing any stop words (such as in, as, is, on, and punctuation), and we lowercase each letter. The suggested approach renders the text into machine-understandable language using word embedding techniques. Text processing is necessary because customer reviews written in language that is understood by humans cannot be read by machines. The data must be in a machine-readable language in order to apply any classification technique. We separate the data into train and test set after the preprocessing is complete. After the training is complete, we use this model on a test set of data to determine its accuracy. Next, we utilize classification methods like logistic regression and XG Boost to see how accurate our model is. This study’s conclusion involves using the model we developed to predict the review based on previous reviews. In this project, we build a model, feed it with existing reviews, apply it to upcoming reviews, and then forecast if the product is good or not. For this work we have taken the data set from Kaggle.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Privacy Preserved and Decentralized Smartphone Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The increasing popularity of mobile phones has led to an abundance of online reviews, making it challenging for consumers to make well-informed purchasing decisions. This study proposes a novel recommendation system-based mobile phone rating classification approach using federated learning and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features. We created a novel dataset by scraping over 13,000 mobile phone reviews from Flipkart’s website. The proposed approach involves the development of a federated deep neural network (FDNN) to classify the newly created Flipkart dataset. This approach includes data cleaning, balancing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and prediction using federated learning. We employ two clients and one server and conduct three rounds of experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 96.68% on the aggregated server side while maintaining the security of customer data on their local devices. The proposed approach has the potential to assist consumers in making well-informed purchasing decisions and can be extended to other e-commerce platforms with large datasets of online reviews.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Novel Multi-User Deep-Learning Offloading Scheme for Virtual Try-On in 5G-Edge Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Virtual Try-On (VTO) technology, powered by Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is reshaping online retail with immersive, real-time user experiences. However, the demand for high-quality, real-time VTO interactions introduces computational and latency challenges. Offloading computations to edge devices, enabled by 5 G networks, offers a promising solution to reduce end-to-end (E2E) latency and support multi-user environments. This paper proposes an optimized VTO platform tailored for edge deployment, featuring a novel knowledge distillation scheme for efficient 3D hand reconstruction. Our knowledge distillation approach reduces the model size by up to 70 % compared to the teacher model, achieving close visual accuracy in simpler tasks, such as flat hand reconstruction, ensuring it meets the quality standards of VTO applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our edge-optimized VTO architecture effectively balances quality and latency, supporting scalable, real-time interactions and advancing VTO technology for next-generation e-commerce applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Fast Sentence Classification using Word Co-occurrence Graphs*</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>We consider a supervised classification problem of categorizing e-commerce products based on just the words in the title. If done in real-time, the categorization can greatly benefit sellers by enabling them to offer immediate feedback. We present a deterministic algorithm by constructing weighted word co-occurrence graphs from the listing/item titles. We empirically evaluate this algorithm on two publicly available product listing datasets, Etsy and Amazon. Our method’s accuracy is comparable to that of a supervised classifier constructed using the fastText library. The inference time of our model is up to 2.9× faster than the fastText classifier and has small training times. The training and inference of our model scales well for big datasets performing large-scale classification on millions of listings. We perform a detailed analysis and provide insights into our method and the product categorization task.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis System using Machine Learning Techniques</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The evolution of e-commerce accompanied with enormous amount of sentiment reviews drive practical difficulty for consumers to decide upon a purchase choice. Sentiment analysis assists in analysing the reviews for a consumer to decide a purchase choice and a manufacturer to follow up on their clients and manage their requirements. Aspect based sentiment analysis is a subtask of sentiment research that aims to identify and analyse sentiment towards specific aspects or features of a target entity within a given text. Aspect extraction from the text input reviews is another important function in sentiment analysis at aspect level. Identifying those aspects and selecting required aspects is very essential task in opinion analysis based on features. In the proposed analysis, we initiate a supervised machine learning technique-decision tree classifier for selecting the required aspects and sentiment research is conducted by utilizing various machine learning techniques. The proposed work gives an accuracy of 85 - 93%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System: A Systematic Review</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS) is a method for handling products, in which a Line Follower Robot (LFR) transports products to a human workstation for packing. In this systematic review, we delve into the current state of RMFS research using data sourced from Scopus. After a comprehensive search, we found 264 manuscripts, which we filtered to 76 relevant articles. Our analysis covers several variables, from basic metadata to manuscript impact and specific conditions the authors consider. We discovered that there needs to be more focus on the pod allocation problem, despite its potential, with the majority of the emphasis on LFR displacement. We created a detailed diagram that outlines the essential elements and subproblems associated with RMFS. As the interest in RMFS continues growing, our study provides crucial insights and direction for future research efforts.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Click Conversion Rate Model of E-Commerce Platforms Aiming at Effective Data Sparse</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Click conversion rate is an important indicator that e-commerce platforms pay attention to. The user's behaviors toward the product on the e-commerce platform, to some extent, indicates a level of love for the product. In order to precisely predict the click conversion rate, this paper suggests a click conversion rate prediction model for e-commerce platforms based on various user behaviors in heterogeneous network. First, in view of the sparseness of interaction information data between users and items on the e-commerce, we take advantage of the ability to discover comparable nodes with the meta-path based random walk method. Simultaneously, the time decay function is introduced in order to construct a sequence of user nodes and a sequence of item nodes with comparable behaviors in the near future. Second, users' interests are diverse. Given that the self-attention mechanism can calculate the degree of association between each node and its neighbors, we propose a multi-head self-attention mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information representing the central node in order to capture the user's interests while improving the model's stability. Finally, to address the phenomenon that users have multiple behaviors under the e-commerce platform, we introduce behavioral weight factors. At the same time, we fill the user and item sequences generated according to the meta-path into the heterogeneous attention network and initialize the importance of user behaviors. Then, we propose the MUB-HAN (Multiple User Behavior Heterogeneous Attention Network) model to further improve the accuracy of click conversion rate. The experiments indicate that the model can generate superior predictions of click conversion rates based on user behavior toward items in e-commerce platforms while incorporating a huge quantity of auxiliary information.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>When Multimodal Large Language Models Meet Computer Vision: Progressive GPT Fine-Tuning and Stress Testing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined the landscape of artificial intelligence, with OpenAI’s GPT-4o representing a transformative leap in multimodal learning and processing. This study pioneers the fine-tuning of GPT-4o on image data, addressing a critical gap in evaluating its performance beyond zero-shot capabilities. It investigates the potential of GPT-4o multimodal LLM for computer vision classification tasks, focusing on e-commerce product categorization through a novel, progressive, few-shot learning fine-tuning framework. Leveraging GPT-4o’s newly available multimodal capabilities, we implemented a four-phase progressive training procedure across varying image resolutions (100, 200, and 400 pixels). Each phase was rigorously evaluated for training duration, computational cost, loss metrics, and validation performance. Predictions were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics while closely monitoring prediction costs and processing time. To establish a benchmark, we replicated the process with ResNet-50 and ConvNeXt-tiny models, applying Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. We explored a range of batch sizes and learning rates using the Optuna library, conducting 100 trials over a maximum of 50 epochs with early stopping and the successive halving pruner to identify optimal configurations for each model. Although ResNet-50 and ConvNeXt-tiny exhibited lower fine-tuning costs, achieving comparable performance required larger batch sizes and lower learning rates. GPT-4o’s multimodal learning approach achieved 87% accuracy with minimal training—just three epochs and a batch size of one—highlighting its efficiency in few-shot learning with limited labeled data. Our findings highlight key trade-offs between cost-efficiency and performance, offering actionable insights for deploying multimodal Large Language Models in resource-constrained scenarios. GPT-4o’s progressive fine-tuning approach showed promising results in computer vision classification tasks, suggesting its potential as a scalable, multimodal AI tool for real-world multimodal learning and vision-based applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Review Authenticity Using Transformers: Web Extension for Detecting AI-Generated Fake Reviews vs Human-Written Feedback</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The importance of the online review system is growing along with the significant increase in internet users. The reliability of online reviews is crucial for businesses since they have a significant influence on their reputation and revenue. It is essential in influencing how people see a good or service, as they are the ones through which customers share their first-hand experience. This study suggests a flexible and user-friendly web plugin while shedding light on the most effective method for locating and eliminating genuine evaluations. The web plugin will have a significant impact on customers and help them form better opinions about a product or service. A supervised learning model is used while deploying the proposed plugin. The user just has to enable the plugin first. The dataset is then retrieved using web scraping tools. Further, in order to extract sound characteristics from the data, it is examined and deconstructed using Natural Language Processing methods. Later predictions are made on the data. Three models namely- BERT, DeBERTa, and XLNet are used for review classification. Based on the experimental results of the study, DeBERTa has a dataset accuracy of 980/0, which is the maximum out of all the three models used. The major goal of this project is to develop a fake survey filtering system that will give clients more trustworthy data and prevent enterprises from losing money dramatically.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>x-ECON: Explainable Event-Consumption Commonsense Reasoning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This article investigates a novel commonsense inference task that comprises reasoning about the subsequent events chains and probable consumption intents, given an event described in brief free-form text. For instance, given the event “fall in love”, the system anticipates ensuing events such as “get married”\rightarrow→“be pregnant”\rightarrow→“have a baby”. Concurrently, the system predicts the likely consumption intents of the event participants, such as purchasing “jewelry”, “maternity clothing”, and “baby food”. The event chains generated in this process provide explicit, meaningful explanations, aiding the understanding of inferred consumption intents. To facilitate this study, we construct a new crowdsourced corpus: x-ECON. This corpus comprises 10,144 event chains and 150 event-related product categories, offering a wide range of everyday consumer events and situations. We introduce a baseline reasoning framework that not only infers consumption intent but also generates an event chain to explain its inference. Our experimental results suggest that involving the event chain reasoning in the event-consumption reasoning system can help improve the neural networks’ reason about the probable consumption intents of the event participants. Additionally, our method demonstrates the applicability of our approach in improving the performance of recommendation systems, by highlighting the role of explainable commonsense inference on the consumption intent. We also evaluated the performance of ChatGPT on our x-ECON dataset, showing that explainable event-consumption commonsense reasoning is a challenging task for large language models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Current Problems and Proposed Solutions for the Electronic Commerce Sector</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid growth of electronic commerce (e-commerce) has revolutionized the global business landscape, transforming the way consumers and businesses interact, purchase, and sell goods and services. However, this sector faces a myriad of challenges that impede its sustainable growth and development. This research paper critically examines the current problems encountered by the electronic commerce sector and proposes viable solutions to address these issues. The study identifies three major problem areas affecting the sector: (1) Security and Privacy Concerns, (2) Logistics and Supply Chain Bottlenecks, and (3) Customer Experience and Trust. Regarding security and privacy, the proliferation of cyber-attacks, data breaches, and identity theft has eroded consumer confidence, hindering e-commerce adoption. The paper aims to investigate the latest technologies and best practices, such as blockchain, advanced encryption techniques, and robust authentication methods, to fortify e-commerce platforms against cyber threats and safeguard user data. The second problem area, logistics and supply chain bottleneck, poses challenges related to order fulfilment, inventory management, and last-mile delivery. Through an in-depth analysis, the research proposes innovative approaches like utilizing machine learning algorithms for predictive inventory management, integrating Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time tracking, and exploring drone and autonomous vehicle deliveries to enhance overall logistics efficiency. The third issue addressed in this paper pertains to customer experience and trust. The inability to tangibly experience products before purchase, coupled with ambiguous return policies, often deters potential customers from engaging in e-commerce transactions. The study delves into augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications to simulate product experiences and advocates for transparent and customer centric return policies. This research paper sheds light on the pressing problems faced by the electronic commerce sector and offers practical solutions to tackle these challenges effectively. By addressing security concerns, optimizing logistics and supply chains, and enhancing the customer experience, stakeholders in the e-commerce industry can foster sustainable growth and build trust among consumers. Policymakers, business leaders, and industry players can utilize these findings to drive positive changes in the e-commerce landscape, thereby accelerating its advancement into the future.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Dynamic Clustering with Deep Learning for Customer Segmentation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customer segmentation is significant for e-commerce as it allows businesses to approach different groups of customers with specialized marketing methods. The clustering techniques, however, are known to struggle in the context of high-dimensional transactional data. In this paper, we investigate a new way of performing clustering, which is termed as dynamic clustering, using deep learning and the Online Retail Dataset. The method described combines autoencoders for feature extraction and GMM for soft clustering in the feature space. Results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved notable improvements in clustering quality, as indicated by metrics such as the Silhouette Score (0.392 for GMM in latent space) and the Davies-Bouldin Index (0.914 for GMM) and provided actionable customer insights. Performance benchmarks also revealed that autoencoders are computationally efficient, handling non-linear features better than PCA, despite being more time-intensive (0.367s vs. 0.025s). When compared against K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering, the approach showed competitive advantages, particularly in adapting to high-dimensional data. The study supports the growing field of customer analytics by offering an effective, scalable clustering framework that enables enriched customer understanding and business growth. Additionally, the versatility of deep learning in solving real-world data segmentation challenges is highlighted, providing avenues for future research to optimize these frameworks further.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Persuade to Click: Context-Aware Persuasion Model for Online Textual Advertisement</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, due to the prevalence of online textual advertisements, increasing businesses recognize their huge potential in product promotion. The high-quality textual content has been empirically shown to have a substantial impact on consumers’ attitudes and decisions. As a result, persuasive tactics play an essential role in online textual advertisements, which are employed to increase the attractiveness, and sequentially increase the conversion rate and sales volume. As the context of persuasion, product attributes, e.g., category and price, also greatly influence the persuasion outcomes. However, they are largely overlooked by existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to study context-aware persuasion by designing a multi-task learning model and performing extensive causal analysis. First, the prediction model recognizes the persuasive tactics employed in an advertising text and predicts their promotion effectiveness. Specifically, we design a disentangled representation learning algorithm to capture the persuasive tactics, and then develop a novel context-aware attention module to model the relationships between persuasive tactics and product attributes. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines. Then we show its great practical value by conducting an in-depth causal analysis of context-aware results that our model learns, which offers insightful interpretations and guidelines for marketers to employ persuasive tactics in textual advertisements.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Caption-Aided Product Detection via Collaborative Pseudo-Label Harmonization</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product detection, which aims to localize products of interest in the advertising images, helps advance many potential E-commerce applications like product retrieval and recommendation. However, labeling a massive number of fine-grained product categories and accurate product boxes is costly and especially not practical since products are ever-changing on E-commerce websites. In this work, we step forward to train a fine-grained product detector solely supervised by the advertising captions, which are naturally available but often severely flawed and noisy. To reformulate the weakly supervised detection research into a real-world setting, we introduce a large-scale benchmark, named CapProduct, where more than 80,000 product image-caption pairs are collected from E-commerce websites. The fine-grained nature of products and noisy captions in CapProduct make it intractable to excavate valid category labels to train a weakly supervised object detector. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Collaborative Pseudo-Label Harmonization (CoPLH) framework that harmonizes self-mined pseudo labels via modeling the global co-occurrence relationships of products. We construct a collaborative co-occurrence graph based on all training samples to improve the reliability of caption-predicted pseudo-labels as well as benefit the self-training procedure in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on the CapProduct dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed CoPLH over the state-of-the-art baselines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Simulation Tool to Provide Alternative Products in Out-of-Stock Situations for B2B Companies</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the rise of online sales and services dedicated to advertising aimed at the profiles of online users, companies selling general products need to adapt their business rules to improve sales strategies. In this paper, we present a simulation tool to support business decision-making, and improve the efficiency of an e-commerce system. It allows testing different sales strategies within the context of Business-to-Business models which focuses on the purchase and sale of non-strategic products. The idea is to provide the client's company with different alternative products when the desired product is out-of-stock. We propose and implement in our simulation tool, three recommendation algorithms, based on sales parameters such as the price and the popularity of products and the similarity between the recommended product and the one out-of-stock. The proposed algorithms are tested with real datasets, which allows evaluating the performance of the recommendation algorithms and their effectiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Using Machine Learning to Improve Lead Times in the Identification of Emerging Customer Needs</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, computational approaches for automatically extracting the voice of the customer from user generated content have been proposed. These studies have tackled the task of obtaining current customer needs, however, there is a lack of methods that predict future needs (i.e. needs that may become popular in the marketplace). Therefore, this study presents a multi-document keyphrase extraction algorithm which predicts future customer needs from users’ social media posts on Reddit. Key to our approach is a novel document filtering method (discovering potentially relevant social media content) and a keyphrase ranking method, which promotes terms with rising frequency likely to be future product needs. In order to evaluate the approach, a case study of “toothpaste” needs is reviewed and a novel evaluation approach using ground truth automatically extracted from a collection of future specifications of new-to-market products is proposed. In our evaluation, we show that the approach is significantly better than simple baselines at identifying customer needs on social media before they trend in the marketplace. We also show that our approach can capture important customer needs identified by a large multinational company with lead times of up to 25 months ahead of them trending in the marketplace. The findings of this research could provide many benefits to businesses such as gaining early access into markets ahead of their competitors and giving early notice to manufacturers/engineers/developers before a need for a product is in demand.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Smell Technology: Advancements and Prospects in Digital Scent Technology and Fragrance Algorithms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Smell technology, a rapidly expanding sector of the scent business, aims to digitally replicate and transmit aromas. Its applications include virtual reality, e-commerce, and healthcare. Recent advances in the field include the creation of smell algorithms and the use of artificial intelligence to create more realistic fragrances. Fragrance algorithms are mathematical models that predict the scent of a fragrance based on its chemical composition. They might be used to the perfume industry to streamline the production of perfumes and do away with the need for expensive trial-and-error methods. Artificial intelligence is also being used to create digital representations of fragrances that closely resemble the real thing by analysing the chemical composition of actual odours. A possible benefit of this technology in the healthcare sector is that synthetic odours may mimic the scents of diseases and aid physicians in making more precise diagnoses. Additionally, some companies are developing small devices that can be connected to computers or mobile devices to emit odours on demand, providing users of virtual reality, gaming, and online shopping with a more realistic experience. In spite of these advancements, it is still exceedingly challenging to recreate the complexity of natural scents, which can include hundreds of different components. With more research and development, there is still a tonne of promise for fragrance technology in the future.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Conscious Cross-Breed Recommendation Approach Confining Cold-Start in Electronic Commerce Systems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>When a new customer enters the spectrum of the E-Commerce system, the informative records and dataset, such as about the new user, purchasing history and other browsing data become insufficient, resulting in the emergence of one serious issue such as a Cold start problem (CSP). Furthermore, when the interaction among the product items becomes limited, a new problem such as Sparsity arises to handle such problems in E-Commerce system, we have designed an extensive and hybridized methodological approach known as Cold start and sparsity aware hybridized recommendation system (CSSHRS), to reduce the Sparsity of dataset as well as to overcome the cold start problem in the recommendation framework. The proposed CSSHRS technique has been predicted by using the dataset of Last. FM, and Book-Crossing resulted in Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 37%, recalls 0.07, precision 0.18, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCD) 0.61, and F-measure 0.1. This article proves the proposed CSSHRS technique as an effective and efficient hybrid of RS against the issue of data sparsity as well as CSP.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Machine Learning Approach for Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews in Bangla Language</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the advent of technology, Sentiment polarity detection has recently piqued the interest of NLP researchers. Sentiment analysis determines the profound meaning of an article. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, online shopping is the safest way of shopping. Moreover, there are product quality and service issues. Our target is to analyze the book reviews which provide positive and negative reviews in Bangla language. For this, a total of 5500 user generated Bengali reviews are collected from various book review pages of social media. In order to get the best possible result, sentiment analysis is used. Thereafter, five different algorithms are applied to predict with almost high accuracy. Among them, the Random Forest provides us the maximum accuracy which is 98.39%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>MTAF: Shopping Guide Micro-Videos Popularity Prediction Using Multimodal and Temporal Attention Fusion Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting the popularity of shopping guide micro-videos incorporating merchandise is crucial for online advertising. What are the significant factors affecting the popularity of the micro-video? How to extract and effectively fuse multiple modalities for the micro-video popularity prediction? This is a question that needs to be urgently answered to better provide insights for advertisers. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal and Temporal Attention Fusion (MTAF) framework to represent and combine multi-modal features. Specifically, we first explore the importance of the micro-video content-agnostic factors using two existing tree-based ensemble methods. Furthermore, we employ three state-of-the-art pre-trained models, BERT, VGGish and ResNet152, to obtain high-level multimodal content representations, including uploaders’ description of products, vocal emotion, facial attractiveness, respectively. In addition, a bi-directional GRU is used to learn early popularity trend characteristics of the micro-video. Finally, a multimodal and temporal attention mechanism layer is designed to combine all features from the multiple sources. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on TikTok e-commerce micro-video dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our model and different modalities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Energy-Efficient Microservices Architecture for Large-Scale E-Commerce Platforms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The more significant the e-commerce websites are and the greater the number of users and transactions each day, the greater the energy demand, both economically and environmentally. The architecture for energy efficiency without compromising performance or scalability is proposed in this paper as an AI-powered hybrid edge-cloud microservices system. The infrastructure intelligently distributes workloads across edge and cloud nodes using AI to identify traffic trends, dynamically assign resources, and run energy efficiently. The design principles are energy-aware microservices, resource scalability, and real-time energy monitoring. The solution saves on overhead using lightweight containerization and allows for elasticity to change. Testing on the ground has proven the architecture to save energy consumption at high-demand times such as Black Friday or latency-sensitive tasks such as personalized retail offers. Implementation issues, scaling of edge nodes, data security are discussed, and more generally, the consequences for viable e-commerce. It builds the basis for greener IT infrastructures and catalyzes innovation toward a sustainable digital future.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unveiling Privacy's Influence on Social Media Customer Behavior: A Machine Learning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In our contemporary society, social media platforms have revolutionized many sectors, most notably the business sector represented by the E-commerce. The social media influence customers to do online shopping and transactions due to the various benefits it offers, as it saves customers time or effort and provides easy access to products and services. As for online providers, social media platforms are considered as backbone and serve as a powerful and effective marketing tool. In the world of online shopping, data collection and analysis play a significant role for businesses, as it guides companies to predict customers behavior and identify trends. However, with this digital transformation, there are some challenges and serious issues, the most prominent of which is privacy concerns and customers anxiety about sharing their personal data with online providers. The main objective of this study is to build a social media customer behavior model based on privacy concerns. Thus, the proposed model addresses the effect of management's intention on privacy, and customers' intention on privacy, and its impact on customers' intention to do transaction, that consequently impact the customer's action to do transaction, thereby leads to customer satisfaction. A structured interviews were conducted with 40 active online shoppers to procure the essential data. The data was analyzed using four distinct machine learning methods, with results indicating that the Random Forest model outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 88%. Among the factors influencing overall customer satisfaction, ‘customer intention to transact’ emerged as the most significant, followed by ‘customer experience’ and 'customer perception of privacy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on User Behavior Prediction Based on Random Forest Algorithm with RFM Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the current e-commerce environment, the application of big data technology has become a key driving force for industry development. By collecting and analyzing massive user behavior data, transaction records, and market trends, e-commerce platforms can offer more personalized shopping experiences, precise product recommendations, and optimized supply chain management. Based on the Random Forest algorithm, this study establishes a prediction model for merchant coupon distribution using user consumption order data. The traditional RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) customer value model is improved by combining it with the Random Forest algorithm to predict merchant coupon distribution. The research results support personalized marketing activities, optimize customer relationship management strategies, and provide targeted coupon distribution strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Case Study to Analyze the Impact of Social Media on Video Game Sales</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Social media data is becoming more and more valuable in analyzing patterns in human behavior as a result of the ongoing expansion of online engagement. Twitter is a great place to find current user-generated data. Anyone can utilize this platform to contribute their own ideas, opinions, or feedback on a variety of issues through Tweets. These topics might come from a variety of industries, including business, politics, and entertainment. On average, 6,000 tweets are uploaded on Twitter every second, for a daily total of over 500 million messages. Understanding the causes and impacts of social, environmental, or financial events can be made much easier by the amount of publicly available information. The data is incredibly beneficial for retailers for market research and sales forecasting when paired with cutting-edge data analysis and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. The proposed study examine the sentiments and statistics that have been submitted by users on the Twitter platform in order to determine whether “Social Media Influencing” has any effect on the video game business.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unveiling Emotions: Exploring Sentiment Analysis on Flipkart Data with the Power of Support Vector Machines and the Intricacies of Random Forest Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce platforms have reshaped consumer shopping, emphasizing customer experience and satisfaction. This study compares sentiment analysis techniques employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Algorithms on a Flipkart dataset. User-authored reviews and ratings are analyzed to categorize sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. The research evaluates data pre-processing methods and measures their efficacy through accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. Findings reveal Random Forest showing a slight advantage over SVM with a marginal deviation of 0.43%, where their individual accuracy rates provision are 94.03% and 93.60% respectively. These results highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach, providing valuable insights for businesses to enhance customer satisfaction and drive growth in the fiercely competitive e-commerce landscape.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Predicting Repurchase Intention Using Textual Features of Online Customer Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In an e-commerce setting, the large volume of online reviews may become a source of data to predict the repurchase intention. Repurchase intention is important for a company because it is related to customer loyalty. A machine-learning based methodology is proposed in this paper to perform the prediction of repurchase intention based on online customer reviews, in order to obtain the insights from a large volume of the available data. The preprocessing of the review texts, the tf-idf representation of words, and the feature selection using Fisher score are the essential components of the methodology. In the case study of an Indonesian cosmetic e-commerce website, it is shown that the inclusion of the textual content of customer reviews results in significantly higher prediction accuracies than using non-textual features (i.e, numerical ratings) only. Furthermore, for each category of repurchase intention labels (i.e., Yes, No, Maybe), a relatively distinct set of words that strongly predict the category is identified. To an extent, the sets reveal customers' reasons that drive the stated repurchase intentions, which are useful for manufacturers to improve their products and design the marketing strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Shetigram - Building a Digital Bridge Between Farmers and Consumers</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Transparency, cutting out middlemen, and fair trade have become essential focuses in agriculture. This paper proposes an innovative e-commerce platform that facilitates direct trans- actions between farmers and end-consumers using Ethereum blockchain smart contracts, leveraging the Elliptic Curve Dig- ital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for secure and transparent transactions. ECDSA enhances security by providing robust authentication, ensuring that all transactions are irrefutable and trustworthy. The platform has a hybrid recommendation system, which uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm for delivering personalized product recommendations that fit each customer's personalized settings. This enables the software to work on natural language processing and this technique captures subtle feelings and contexts, thereby enhancing recommendation accuracy and diversification. Besides ARIMA, XGBoost algorithm, one of the machine learning methods, is applied to predict agricultural commodity prices and the demand, in this way by considering the internal, external, and seasonal factors that can create credit for each commodity provides much more accurate predictions and decision-making insights. XGBoost is a non-linear algorithm that wins in the comparison of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE as it continued to improve by capturing more factors and patterns associated with changes in the models. The platform aims to solve the problem of farmers being disadvantaged due to the lack of access to smartphones and internet connectivity. It will be done by integration of USSD-based interface that enables wide participation with basic mobile devices.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AR-VR Connectivity for Learning / Motivation for Dyslexia Kids</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>It typically takes a long time to strike an item in the store. However, wearing clothing is not always practicable, particularly when purchasing online. Online shopping has become much more popular in recent years, mostly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown. The consumer wants to know how the item will look before making a purchase, such as clothes. This is the main reason why online sales of clothing have declined. Therefore, offering a wide range of possibilities for customers, an online digital fitting room might be a remarkable luxury for online shops. I think that people can see how the clothes help them in this way. Online shopping is a fantastic tool that retailers can use to grow their marketplace. Our objective is to use a digital becoming room to enhance accessibility and fitting appointment performance. We suggest an Open-CV-based fitting room software that is fully virtual for online transactions to achieve this goal.The virtual try-on room is a modern choice that provides online buyers with a customized and interesting purchasing experience. As e-commerce becomes more widespread, customers have the problem of not being able to try goods before they buy. Giving customers the option to digitally try on clothes in a try-on facility solves this issue. This option also improves convenience and saves time for consumers who do not have the time or who like to visit a store. With the use of a digital try-on room, customers can simply try on various designs and sizes, forecast how items will look before purchasing them, and buy apparel from the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, it helps e-trade businesses by improving customer happiness and reducing measurement problems and revenue opportunities. When all is said and done, An inventive way to connect traditional in-store and online buying is the Virtual Trail Room. By giving customers, a personalized and fulfilling shopping experience, this raises customer satisfaction and boosts online firms' profits.

        <dc:title>Fake Product Review Monitoring System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As e-commerce and internet buying have grown in popularity, it is impossible to underestimate the significance of genuine product reviews. False evaluations which are meant to mislead prospective clients provide serious difficulties for both customers and companies. False reviews can be written by both the buyer to mislead the other customers and the seller to degrade the product quality and sale of the competitor. This study presents a complete system for monitoring fraudulent product reviews that makes use of sentiment analysis, content similarity and review deviation techniques by assuming some threshold values. Along with this the best model is been saved for the future prediction on the new unseen reviews. Also the system uses three potent machine learning classifiers: Random forest, Logistic regression and support vector machine and after the comparison it has been observed that Random forest best performs out of the other. It is observed that all three methods contribute in monitoring the fake reviews patterns.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Data-Driven Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce using K-Means Clustering for Personalized Marketing Strategies</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the big data era, precision marketing in e-commerce has become ever more important in order to target prospective customers with high relevance. The present research focuses on applying K-means clustering as an effective method of precision marketing on e-commerce platforms. The overall idea is customer data segmentation through buying behavior, demographics, and web browsing history in order to support personalized marketing strategy. Current systems tend to be based on rule-based or broad demographic targeting, which is not precise and does not account for dynamic customer behavior. Conventional methods like RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and decision trees are not scalable and flexible. The proposed model uses K-means clustering to efficiently segment customers into significant groups, thus allowing businesses to launch targeted campaigns with greater relevance. Experimental outcomes show significant improvement over legacy approaches, with an accuracy of 98.2%, F1-score of 97.7%, and improved segmentation quality. Comparative evaluation shows that K-means greatly surpasses legacy models in terms of precision and recall. The superiority of the model is in its unsupervised learning capability to learn automatically hidden patterns, providing a scalable, data-driven approach to improved e-commerce marketing performance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommender Systems and Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Technology is advancing rapidly is today’s day and age. Machine learning and artificial intelligence algotrithms in particular have seen huge leaps forward in the past few years. AI is being used everywhere, from education to medicine, from tourism to marketing. Recommender systems belong to a class of machine learning algorithms which are used to provide personalized recommendations to a user of a service, helping them make faster and better purchase decisions. Because of this recommender systems have reshaped the online marketplace drastically and have become essential to any online seller. Because of the same, it has become a popular data science domain and many researchers have developed various different types of algorithms and techniques to suit each type of implementation of the systems. In this paper, we discuss the various types of recommender systems, their importance and applications, and develop a small model for understanding.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on Bargaining Algorithm of Unmanned Vending Machine Based on Game Strategy</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Traditional unmanned vending machines currently do not have the function of bargaining, and cannot provide consumers with personalized bargaining intelligent services. Based on the psychological benefits of users being more inclined to buy discounted goods, the study aims to introduce the bargaining function to unmanned vending machines. Use bargaining to stimulate paid conversions of purchases. This is similar to a business scheme that uses discounts on goods or issues coupons to stimulate customers to pay. This study makes up for the gap in the bargaining function of unmanned vending machines, which is of great significance. Based on the game strategy, this study establishes a set of algorithmic models for unmanned vending machine bargaining. The algorithmic model applies five different sub-algorithms. When the unmanned vending machine bargains with the customer, the algorithm model only randomly selects one of the sub-algorithm models within a fixed period of time. Next, the selected sub-algorithm performs the commodity bargaining game operation and outputs the game result. Therefore, the algorithm is applied to unmanned vending machines, adding personalized bargaining functions. It meets the bargaining expectations and purchase needs of different customers. In a limited space, the article focuses on the implementation of mathematical principles of unmanned vending machine bargaining algorithm based on game strategy. The study describes the interaction between the two sides of the game. In this study, simulation experiments are carried out to verify the accuracy of the algorithm model by analyzing a series of parameters.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Practice on Personalized Recommendation Strategies Using Deep Learning Algorithms in Online Marketing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the penetration of big data into various fields of economic life, banks, insurance, transportation, e-commerce, education, healthcare and other fields have generated massive data and information flows, and gradually developed big data sales systems represented by Taobao, JD.com, and others. In this context, “reconstruction” and “subversion” are the key to building personalized marketing systems for retail enterprises. However, personalized marketing is not a new concept. It is based on the modern information way, through the construction of personalized customer service system, so that enterprises can measure and expand channels at a lower cost. This is also the core of Internet marketing. Therefore, in the context of big data, conducting personalized marketing can help industries and enterprises better find target customers, achieve precise management of them, and obtain profits from them. Therefore, this article integrated personalized marketing and customer loyalty in retail enterprises into a common research framework, and explored the impact mechanism of personalized marketing on customer loyalty on this basis. This article constructed a personalized recommendation model by collecting and analyzing user behavior data, combined with deep learning algorithms. The experimental results showed that the click through rate of the experimental group (Group B) in March was r_B&gt;55 %, while the highest click through rate of the control group (Group A) did not exceed 60 %. This shows that the recommended model of bipartite projection is progressiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Web Usage Mining Techniques for Enhancing Business Applications</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid growth of online businesses, particularly in e-commerce, has led to increased competition, making customer satisfaction and engagement critical for business success. Indeed, techniques related to web usage mining have emerged as one of the most powerful means to analyze user behavior, based on which businesses can make decisions based on data and work in the direction of improving services. Overall, however, these are not such widely adopted techniques across industries. A number of web usage mining techniques are discussed in this study: Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Elastic Net, K-Neighbors Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor-to present their performance in analyzing online user behavior. Each of these methodologies was based on secondary data sourced online and had been evaluated on the basis of RMSE and MAE. The Random Forest Regressor gave the best performance, with a root mean square error of 5,106,744 and a mean absolute error of 1,576. Its closest competitor was the XGBoost Regressor, with an RMSE of 5,140,422 and a mean absolute error of 1,605. The models using traditional methods, such as Linear Regression and Elastic Net, had more errors, with RMSEs over 15 million, mean absolute errors over 3,265. This clearly shows that with the powers of ensembling learning methods-most importantly, Random Forest and XGBoost-accurate user behavior prediction could be had with the betterment of a variety of business applications. The insight that web usage mining provides about how customers interact on the site makes it very important for e-commerce companies in the quest to arrive at better decisions and improvements in customer satisfaction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research on Factors Affecting Consumer Purchasing Behavior on E-commerce Website During COVID-19 Pandemic based on RBF-SVM Network</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The proposed model is able to forecast online purchases by creating a connection between site visitors’ behaviors and the information to which they are exposed. Many modeling challenges arise when attempting to predict purchases made on the Internet. Models of online purchase need to consider the heterogeneity of users because online retailers reach a wide variety of people in a variety of competitive settings. The low probability of making a purchase online also reduces the predictive and explanatory power of models. Customers must complete the product configuration, fill up their personal information, and confirm the order with their payment information before making a purchase. The proposed strategy requires the processing of data, the selection of features, and the training of a model. Natural language processing and normalization are examples of preprocessing that can be used to data collected from e-commerce websites. Specifically, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is employed to select the features. Models are trained using an RBF-SVM hybrid approach. The proposed methodology outperforms SVM and RBF, two popular current methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Customized Transformer for Confident Browse Node Classification on Imbalanced Product Data</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Rapid digitization of the world has revitalized the potential of AI. As a result, this phenomenon awakened a huge demand for data-mining pipelines that can efficiently process massive volumes of data to generate valuable insights. For instance, the e-commerce industry is a hub for such high-capacity analytical pipelines as the big players in this industry deal with data pertaining to millions of products, transactions, and users. Consequently, the sheer amount of data used in such AI workflows gives rise to Scalability issues and resource-efficiency issues. As a result, there is a necessity for more computationally efficient approaches that optimize resource allocation and minimize infrastructure costs. Thus, this paper focuses on implementing an efficient product classification pipeline using a customized version of a state-of-the-art transformer-based model which is able to efficiently process data volumes that are comparable to the current voluminosity of industrial data. This customized workflow adapts a loss function that was originally developed for object detection and this adaptation has proved to help the model converge faster and combat class imbalance which is a serious issue in developing large-scale Natural Language Processing systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Empirical Study on Algorithmic Bias</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In all goal-oriented selection activities, an existence of certain level of bias is unavoidable and may be desired for efficient artificial intelligence based decision support systems. However, a fair independent comparison of all eligible entities is essential to alleviate explicit bias in competitive marketplace. For example, searching online for a good or service, it is expected that the underlying algorithm will provide fair results by searching all available entities in the category mentioned. However, a biased search can make a narrow or collaborative query, ignoring competitive outcomes, resulting customers in costing more or getting lower quality products or services for the money they spend. This paper describes algorithmic bias in different contexts with examples and scenarios, best practices to detect bias, and two case studies to identify algorithmic bias.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Applications</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>This study investigates the impact of augmented reality (AR) virtual try-on technology on consumer behavioral intentions in the online fashion retail sector. The growth of online apparel shopping has created unique challenges for consumers, especially those who try on before buying. Using a mixed methods approach combining a literature review and a questionnaire survey, this study identified and explored key factors that influence users' willingness to engage in a virtual try-on experience. Results showed that personality traits had no significant impact on AR perceptions, but had a positive impact on AR simplicity, usefulness, interactivity, immersion, and realism. Notably, perceived usefulness and immersion were identified as key factors influencing intention to use the technology. From a practical perspective, the findings provide valuable insights for retailers, highlighting the importance of providing unique AR experiences to enhance customer engagement. This study demonstrates the potential of AR applications to positively influence consumers and brands, and supports their integration into digital platforms to enhance online shopping experiences and grow e-commerce.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Community Discovery and TrustRank based Approach for Spammer Ranking</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Driven by profit incentives, spammers deliberately post fake reviews to promote or demote the reputation of online stores or products. As review spamming behaviors spread fast in e-commerce domain, spammers usually collaborate to write fake reviews to effect target products. Previous research mainly focuses on fake review detection and spammer detection using supervised machine learning techniques. In order to solve the problem of lack of supervised learning data for spammer detection, we propose a reviewer suspiciousness ranking algorithm based on community discovery and TrustRank. First, we use overlapping community discovery technology to find highly suspicious user communities as candidate spammer groups. Then we realize an improved algorithm CommunityRank based on initial value of suspiciousness of reviewer in candidate groups. Experiment results show that CommunityRank performs better than baseline methods in ranking of spammers and can effectively improve performance of spammer ranking in unsupervised environment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimizing Scalable Data-Driven Recommendations with Evolutionary Algorithms for Predictive Analytics</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Evolutionary algorithms are optimization techniques inspired by the natural selection processes, which refine candidate solutions iteratively by selection, crossover, and mutation. This kind of algorithm is particular to solving complex problems with large search spaces, and they are often used in domains like data-driven e-commerce product recommendation systems. Within this paper, an innovative evolutionary algorithm is proposed to optimize scalable, data-driven recommendations within e-commerce systems. The most important aspect is the efficient management of large datasets, which is the hallmark of contemporary e-commerce platforms. The algorithm begins with an initialization of a diverse population of candidate solutions, which refers to different product recommendations based on a user's preferences. A sound fitness function is utilized to ascertain the goodness of candidate recommendations through the evaluation criteria of engagement and accuracy founded upon historical interaction data. The proposed evolutionary algorithm performs significantly better as it achieved accuracy with a precision of 98.9% at 97%, recall at 99%, and with an F1-Score of 98.3 %. The evolutionary search is a sequence of iterated cycles applying selection, crossover, and mutation operations to progressively refine the candidate solutions during such a process. Selection has the choices with the higher fitness values as preferred candidates.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendation System Issues, Approaches and Challenges Based on User Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the ever-increasing volume of online information, recommender systems have been effective as a strategy to overcome information overload. They have a wide range of applications in many fields, including e-learning, e-commerce, e-government and scientific research. Recommender systems are search engines that are based on the user's browsing history to suggest a product that expresses their interests. Being usually in the form of textual comments and ratings, such reviews are a valuable source of information about users' perceptions. Recommender systems (RSs) apply various approaches to predict users' interest on information, products and services among a huge amount of available items. In this paper, we will describe the recommender system, discuss ongoing research in this field, and address the challenges, limitations and the techniques adopted. This paper also discusses how review texts are interpreted to solve some of the major problems with traditional recommendation techniques. To assess the value of a recommender system, qualitative evaluation measures are discussed as well in this research. Based on a series of selected articles published between 2008 and 2020, the study allowed us to conclude that the efficiency of RSs is strongly centered on the control of information context, the operated exploration algorithm, the method, and the type of processed data in addition to the information on users' trust.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Real-Time Auction Platform using Fuzzy Logic with Advanced Web Technologies</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>An auction system is a process for the exchange of goods, where items are sold to the highest bidder following a set of predefined rules. With the growth of e-commerce, auction systems have become increasingly popular, providing users with an easier way to buy and sell products than traditional marketplaces. However, identifying and notifying the successful bidder can be a complex task in online auctions. Research suggests utilizing a Fuzzy Logic Technique to effectively analyze the bidding process and determine the winner. This approach uses the Fuzzy Triangular Membership Function to assign membership values. Four input variables are converted into fuzzy linguistic terms in the input-output relationships.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Testing Framework for Blockchain-Based Energy Trade Microgrids Applications</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Distributed energy generation disrupts traditional energy markets by blurring the line between producers and consumers and enabling the emerging prosumers to trade energy in per-to-peer transactions. Blockchain technology automates peer-to-peer energy trades in a distributed database architecture that achieves security and cost-effectiveness using cryptographic hashing and consensus-based verification. Before its deployment, an energy blockchain trading application needs to be tested in a virtual environment that is analogous to the real-world setting to ensure correct implementation and identify potential obstacles and opportunities. This study suggests executing such a testing within a framework that integrates a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment with an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulation platform. The application of this testing framework to a case study of solar Photovoltaic (PV) energy trade among household peers in in Doha, Qatar, shows how the integration of the GIS environment offers a detailed analysis of transactions in local housing community markets. The ABM simulation reveals that population density, energy market prices, and household proximity significantly influence residential PV energy trading in Qatar. The ensuing simulation environment provides a decision-support platform for designing and implementing decentralized trading systems based on blockchain technology, and high-performance computing can enhance model performance for scalable energy blockchain analysis in Qatar and beyond.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Internet of Things in Marketing Communication Landscape</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The application of IoT in marketing communications is necessary in the context of services that connect individuals, groups, and broader community networks related to all devices, places of work, and service locations using relevant information. This research aims to analyze IoT in marketing communications in several dimensions, such as the ecosystem formed and the process of collecting and processing marketing data. Systematic literature review (SLR) of 59 academic papers was analyzed using coding and interpretation procedures. The research results show that the network system fund information works in the marketing communication landscape. In IoT, an information ecosystem is formed, and its network plays a role in developing participatory marketing. Marketing communication data is collected and processed in IoT by generating efficient messages through specific channels to send messages to the target market.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Multiple Behaviors Recommendation with Graph Learning</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommendation systems have been extensively investigated by existing studies. However, previous work only targets a single type of user behavior (e.g., purchase) while ignoring the fact that users usually have multiple behaviors when browsing products (e.g., view, click, add-to-cart). These different behaviors can generate a large number of attributes about users. Meanwhile, in typical collaborative filtering (CF) systems, users and items are generally handled separately. Therefore, the associativity between users and items is not taken into account. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel framework named as Multiple Behaviors recommendation with Graph Learning (MBGL). To capture multiple characteristics of users and items, we construct a knowledge graph with multiple entity relations between users and items from a variety of data, such as purchase, view, and add-to-cart. We apply the knowledge graph embedding (KGE) method to learn the pre-training embedding of entity and relation. To better learn high-hop embedding from multi-behavior data, we construct a heterogeneous user-item graph and further design relation-aware GAT to learn graph embedding with relation type. To support high-order dependency in the graph, we introduce the residual network to solve feature smoothing and vanishing gradient problems. Moreover, to obtain the high-quality user and item embedding, we design an attention fusion layer to learn the fusion embedding and adopt the multi-task learning to predict users' preferences under different behaviors. Experiment results on real-world dataset show that our model outperforms other recommendation methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>5 Pre Filtering with Rule Mining for Context Based Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommendation systems have been the integral part of web and mobile applications in the domains of e commerce, e learning, e health, e governance, social networking and search engines. The problem of spending more time in getting the required relevant information from the many options available, also called as the information overload problem is addressed by the recommendation systems. The context based recommendation systems are the types of recommendation systems which use the context information to provide the recommended items. The context is the data about the application or the surroundings or the purpose with which the user is interacting with the system which can be like time, location, type of product, user’s purpose or any situation describing the interaction. In this work the architecture of the context based recommendation system is proposed with the pre filtering method with context rules. The class and object based model of context with rules and recommendation system is proposed which can be converted into a relational model for data storage for the recommendation system. One of the actions like rating is used to predict the preference of items for the current user. The analysis of the system is carried out with the Het Rec 2011 Movielens data set. The accuracy measure MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is analysed in the proposed work and the relevance is measured in terms of precision, recall and F1 measure. The experimental result shows the influence of context on action and improvement in quality of recommendation with the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A New Business Proposal for Attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals Based on Data Mining</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are international goals aimed at achieving a sustainable and better world by 2030. As the importance of the SDGs grows these years, more and more people are becoming aware of them. However, compared to the high awareness, progress towards the SDGs in Japan is still low due to many people not putting the SDGs into practice. To address this issue, this paper adopts data from ADK General Consumer Survey 2020 and conducts analysis on it based on data mining techniques. We first conduct factor analysis on the consumption tendency of people who show low affirmations towards the SDGs, then construct a prediction model to predict people’s affirmations towards the SDGs using machine learning methods. Based on these endeavors, we propose a new business aiming to encourage people to buy more sustainable products and contribute to the society’s attainment of the SDGs. This paper also devises the mobile app for our proposed business and illustrates its application in reality. Although our new business mainly targets the Japanese market, it can also be introduced to other regions to promote the realization of a sustainable society.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>AI-Driven Data Monetization: The Other Face of Data in IoT-Based Smart and Connected Health</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>As the trajectory of the Internet of Things (IoT) moving at a rapid pace and with the rapid worldwide development and public embracement of wearable sensors, these days, most companies and organizations are awash in massive amounts of data. Determining how to profit from data deluge can give companies an edge in the market because data have the potential to add tremendous value to many aspects of a business. The market has already seen a level of monetization across vertical domains in the form of layering connected devices with a variety of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) choices, such as subscription plans or smart device insights. Out of this arena is evolving a “machine economy” in which the ability to correctly monetize data rather than simply hoard it, will provide a significant advantage in a competitive digital environment. The recent advent of the technological advances in the fields of big data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new avenues of competition, where data are utilized strategically and treated as a continuously changing asset able to unleash new revenue opportunities for monetization. Such growth has made room for an onslaught of new tools, architectures, business models, platforms, and marketplaces that enable organizations to successfully monetize data. In fact, emerging business models are striving to alter the power balance between users and companies that harvest information. Start-ups and organizations are offering to sell user data to data analytics companies and other businesses. Monetizing data goes beyond just selling data. It is also possible to include steps that add value to data. Generally, organizations can monetize data by: 1) utilizing it to make better business decisions or improve processes; 2) surrounding flagship services or products with data; or 3) selling information to current or new markets. This article will address all important aspects of IoT data monetization with more focus on the healthcare industry and discuss the corresponding challenges, such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, security, and privacy. In addition, it presents a holistic reference architecture for the healthcare data economy with an in-depth case study on the detection and prediction of cardiac anomalies using multiparty computation (MPC) and privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) techniques.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Efficient Load Interference Detection with Limited Labeled Data</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The logistics industry is facing major labor shortages owing to the increasing production volume driven by the continued expansion of e-commerce. This situation has accelerated the development of solutions such as autonomous forklifts. For these forklifts to perform stable material handling, the accurate detection of the load state is essential. However, logistics data often contain sensitive information related to customer products, hindering the collection of comprehensive datasets for developing detection technologies based on machine learning. We propose a method for accurately detecting the position and shape of a load as a mask using limited load data and subsequently identifying the interference state between loads based on the predicted masks. The proposed method leverages instance segmentation pre-trained with formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) to achieve highly accurate mask prediction, even with limited labeled data for fine-tuning. Pre-training using FDSL leads to a high detection accuracy with a mean average precision (intersection-over-union threshold of 90) of 91.0% using only 400 images. Furthermore, interference detection based on the predicted masks reaches high rates, with a precision of 95.0% and recall of 95.0% on an evaluation set that includes loads with and without interference. Our findings indicate that accurate load interference detection can be achieved with limited labeled data, possibly contributing to the advancement of automation in the logistics industry.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Classifying Customers’ Journey from Online Reviews of Amazon Fresh via Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A positive customer journey experience is necessary to maintain customer loyalty in online retailing. After the outbreak of Covid-19, there has been a significant increase in the number of customers who buy online groceries. Due to the anonymity and convenience throughout the customer journey, E-grocery shopping platforms have become a reliable source for gathering online customer reviews. In the study, we used text mining and machine learning (ML) models to an e-grocery customer review database from the Amazon Fresh website to forecast customer feelings in the data set. To be more specific, this study aimed to determine whether the customers are satisfied with the online purchase of products or not. Further, the study aims to analyze whether the customers would recommend the purchased products or not. For sentiment analysis a sample of 78,619 reviews was used. We used a linguistic approach consisting of ML and dictionary scoring algorithms to forecast customers’ sentiment based on their reviews. Topic modeling (TM) on 3,26,120 customer reviews was used to reveal “themes” from customer reviews to grasp a better knowledge of customers experiences.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Integrating Business Intelligence and Recommendation Marketplace System for Hawker Using Content Based Filtering</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The hawker industry is known for its diverse food options and affordable prices, but customers often struggle to select their preferred hawker stalls due to the abundance of choices. To address this challenge, this research proposes the integration of business intelligence techniques with a recommendation marketplace system using content-based filtering. This research aims to enhance the hawker dining experience by providing personalised recommendations based on customer preferences and leveraging data-driven insights. The objectives of this study are to collect and integrate data from various sources, including hawker stall information, customer preferences, and feedback. This research will employ content-based filtering techniques to analyse this data and develop a recommendation engine that suggests hawker stalls and food options aligned with users' preferences and past interactions. Through this integration, this project seeks to derive valuable insights from the collected data, such as identifying popular food categories, analysing customer behaviour, and understanding customer satisfaction levels. These insights will enable us to optimise the recommendation marketplace system, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the overall customer experience. This paper presents a mobile-based recommendation system that allows customers to explore personalised hawker stall recommendations based on their preferences. By integrating business intelligence with a recommendation marketplace system for hawker food, this research contributes to improving the decision-making process for customers, promoting hawker stall visibility and revenue, and creating a personalised and enjoyable dining experience.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Localization and Recommendation System IOT-based Solution for Smart Supermarkets</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, supermarkets and shopping malls suffer from crowds and long cashier queues. This gives customers a rough shopping experience, and many will reconsider shopping in crowded supermarkets unless a safe, fast, and smooth shopping experience is presented. Thus, solving supermarkets' problems smartly using wireless communication technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) is considered one of the most recent and essential challenges, making it a hot research area. In this paper, we propose a smart supermarket solution that eliminates the leading supermarket problems, such as tedious cashiers with long and crowded queues for the billing process and wasting time searching for specific products in huge and crowded supermarkets. Moreover, the proposed solution also provides an efficient advertising and marketing tool using data analysis and machine learning, easing the supermarket's inventory management. In this regard, to validate the proposed solution, a prototype system is implemented to test the system functionalities and estimate the total cost of this prototype. In the future, the proposed solution can be easily implemented on an accurate commercial scale. As compared to existing supermarket systems, the proposed model is more competitive.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Personalized Review Summarization by Using Graph-Based Retrieval Augmemted Generation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Review summarization aims to provide a summary that covers the main aspect of the product review and reflects personal preference. Existing methods employ the historical reviews of customer and product to provide useful clues for the target summary generation. However, most of the existing methods indiscriminately model the historical reviews of customer and product. Since the historical customer reviews provide the personal information while the historical product reviews provide the commonly focused aspect of the product, these two types of heterogeneous information should be separately modeled. Moreover, the review rating of the historical reviews can be seen as a high-level abstraction of the customer preference and product which have been ignored by most of the existing methods. In this paper, we propose the Heterogeneous Historical Review aware Review Summarization (HHRRS) which separately models the two types of historical reviews with the rating information by a graph reasoning module with a contrastive loss. We employ a multi-task paradigm that conducts the review sentiment classification and summarization jointly. And we also propose a novel Graph Retrieval Augmemted Review Summarization (GRARS) to model the two types of heterogeneous information in a fine-grained manner. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of HHRRS on both tasks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Virtual Dressing Room Application Using GANs</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in the idea of a virtual clothing try-on, which entails placing an image of a desired outfit on a mannequin. In order to give the user the idea that they are trying on the item, the standard try-on task attempts to provide a natural fit between the target clothing and the provided body. However, in real life, people may also care about how they &quot;try on&quot; in various stances. We offer a novel try- on setting that enables modification of both the garment and the model's posture in order to address this problem. To this purpose, we present a generative adversarial networks–based pose- guided virtual try-on technique (GANs). By initially predicting how the semantic layout of the reference image will change throughout the try- on process, it is possible to create a photorealistic try-on with a plethora of garment details. There are three individual parts to this. Initially, a reference image's semantic segmentation is used by a semantic layout generation module to progressively forecast the tried-on garment's desired semantic layout. A garments warping module then applies a second-order difference constraint to the created semantic layout in order to change clothing pictures while preserving the transformation's consistency over the course of training. Third, a module that can adapt to produce each semantic component of the human body from a variety of inputs (such as reference image, semantic layout, and distorted clothing). It outperforms cutting-edge generative models in the image-based virtual try-on task, according to our tests on the newly acquired dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Analysis and research of e-commerce user behavior data based on Spark framework</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the progress and development of The Times, data is becoming more and more important to us. The arrival of Big data has innovated technology in computers and other industries, bringing us into the era of big Data. Due to the rapid development of e-commerce, many e-commerce platforms now use big data technology or cloud computing for data management. At present, the most used big data frameworks are Hadoop and Spark. Through analyzing user behavior data obtained from e-commerce platforms, users' preferences can be guessed and recommended to meet users' needs. Therefore, understanding user behavior is a necessary condition for the development of the e-commerce industry. This paper analyzes the data from the perspective of big data. The data is processed, mined and analyzed through the real data provided by the operators of relevant platforms and corresponding results are obtained. By analyzing users' behaviors and integrating and classifying these data by means of mean clustering algorithm, naive Bayes method, decision tree algorithm and other methods, e-commerce platforms can predict users' favorite and preferred products according to these classified data, which can provide users with corresponding products in a more targeted manner and save each other's time. This paper starts with the preprocessing of e-commerce user behavior data, user behavior feature data mining and user behavior analysis, classifies user data, analyzes the data by classification, and obtains the results. Finally, through the construction of virtual machines and Spark framework environment, the user behavior data of the e-commerce platform is analyzed to obtain the corresponding user purchase information data, and the purchase intention of users is analyzed according to these data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Commodity Personalized Recommendation Algorithm Based on the Knowledge Graph</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Personalized recommendation systems have become an important part of e-commerce, social media, and other applications. However, the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm is only based on the user's scoring history of the product, ignoring the attributes and characteristics of the product itself. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a personalized recommendation algorithm based on knowledge graph, which can combine the similarity between goods and user preferences to make recommendations and add the scoring mechanism, thus improving the accuracy and practicability of the recommendation system. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional user-based and item-based co-filtering algorithms in evaluation indexes such as accuracy, recall and F1 value, demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of this algorithm in the field of personalized recommendation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Impact of Phishing Attacks on Mobile Intelligent Agent Systems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Phishing attacks continue to evolve with time, and the attackers are always ahead of existing mitigation plans. The more technology advances, the more sophisticated phishing attacks become. As more people rely on technology to conduct their online businesses, the need for secure Mobile Intelligent Agent systems (MIAs) becomes greater. MIAs are software that executes functions or duties such as managing electronic mail and gathering and sending out information on behalf of an online user. Organisations of different sizes continue to lose millions in revenue because of phishing attacks aimed at MIAs. The challenge is to determine the impact of phishing attacks which often result in millions of dollars because of the reputational damage, lawsuits, and loss of production. In this paper, we present a model that can be used by organizations of different sizes to quantify the impact of phishing attacks. The models are formulated based on data in our possession. The proposed model proved to be effective and easy to use for organizations of different sizes as computations can be carried out using the models presented.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Efficient Multi-threaded Collaborative Filtering Approach in Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender systems are a subset of information filtering systems designed to predict and suggest items that users may find interesting or relevant based on their preferences, behaviors, or interactions. By analyzing user data such as past activities, ratings, and preferences, these systems generate personalized recommendations for products, services, or content, with common applications including online retail, media streaming platforms, and social media. Recommender systems are typically categorized into three types: content-based filtering, which recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in; collaborative filtering, which analyzes the preferences of similar users; and hybrid methods, which combine both approaches to improve accuracy. These systems enhance user experience by reducing information overload and providing personalized suggestions, thus increasing engagement and satisfaction. However, building a scalable recommendation system capable of handling numerous users efficiently is a significant challenge, particularly when considering both performance consistency and user data security, which are emerging research topics. The primary objective of this research is to address these challenges by reducing the processing time in recommendation systems. A multithreaded similarity approach is employed to achieve this, where users are divided into independent threads that run in parallel. This parallelization significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional methods, resulting in a faster, more efficient, and scalable recommendation system that ensures improved performance without compromising user data security.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Learning Vertex Representations for Bipartite Networks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recent years have witnessed a widespread increase of interest in network representation learning (NRL). By far most research efforts have focused on NRL for homogeneous networks like social networks where vertices are of the same type, or heterogeneous networks like knowledge graphs where vertices (and/or edges) are of different types. There has been relatively little research dedicated to NRL for bipartite networks. Arguably, generic network embedding methods like node2vec and LINE can also be applied to learn vertex embeddings for bipartite networks by ignoring the vertex type information. However, these methods are suboptimal in doing so, since real-world bipartite networks concern the relationship between two types of entities, which usually exhibit different properties and patterns from other types of network data. For example, E-Commerce recommender systems need to capture the collaborative filtering patterns between customers and products, and search engines need to consider the matching signals between queries and webpages. This work addresses the research gap of learning vertex representations for bipartite networks. We present a new solution BiNE, short for Bipartite Network Embedding, which accounts for two special properties of bipartite networks: long-tail distribution of vertex degrees and implicit connectivity relations between vertices of the same type. Technically speaking, we make three contributions: (1) We design a biased random walk generator to generate vertex sequences that preserve the long-tail distribution of vertices; (2) We propose a new optimization framework by simultaneously modeling the explicit relations (i.e., observed links) and implicit relations (i.e., unobserved but transitive links); (3) We explore the theoretical foundations of BiNE to shed light on how it works, proving that BiNE can be interpreted as factorizing multiple matrices. We perform extensive experiments on five real datasets covering the tasks of link prediction (classification) and recommendation (ranking), empirically verifying the effectiveness and rationality of BiNE. Our experiment codes are available at: https://github.com/clhchtcjj/BiNE.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Comparison of Transformer-based Architectures for Product Categorization</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The fast &amp; continuous evolution of e-commerce search engines globally has encouraged researchers &amp; industry specialists alike to improve product categorization models to elevate user experience. Also, the revolutionary emergence of large language models has given us the opportunity to capture the complex relationships and dependencies found in large datasets that we were not able to discover with traditional techniques, and not to mention the multitude of other natural language understanding tasks it performs. In this paper, we aim to evaluate different transformer-based architectures on the Amazon Shopping Queries dataset to determine which architecture is well-suited for the task of product categorization within an e-commerce platform.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Approach to Improve the Accuracy of Detecting Spam in Online Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Customers or user opinion is the most important and valuable information at online nowadays, especially in product reviews. Mostly customer used to make their decision for purchasing a particular product based on the other's customer reviews. Those reviews are increasing the rating of that e-commerce site. Normally, reviews are considered unbiased opinion of a person who has personal experience with a related specific product. The noticeable thing is that many reviewers reviews are not real or authentic. These kinds of feedback are usually called spam, and it is becoming a large problem in online and other electronic communication. As the value of online reviews is getting increased, the spammers are getting inspired to doing spam for them or promoting a specific e-commerce website. Also, they are demoting a specific site for payment. In this paper, we have discussed some traditional techniques for detecting spam in online public opinions. Next, we have used the stacking algorithm with some traditional classifiers for the detection of spam reviews. Finally, the performance of different classifiers has evaluated through a simulation experiment. From the experiments, we have seen that stacking classifier provides better accuracy than other traditional classifiers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Leveraging ANFIS and Evolutionary Algorithms to Predict Mobile App Success on Google Play</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid expansion of the mobile phone market has driven the growth of mobile applications, making the global app industry highly competitive and lucrative. As developers strive to maintain revenue and market position, predicting the success of mobile apps before their release has become increasingly important. This research focuses on the Google Play Store, the largest app marketplace worldwide, where metrics like app installations and user ratings serve as key indicators of market performance in the absence of direct revenue data. To address this challenge, we developed a predictive model using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), enhanced by optimization techniques such as Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The study utilized a dataset of 10,841 Android applications from the Google Play Store, key input features include Category, Size, Type, and Content Rating, while the output is defined as the product of user Rating and Installations to reflect app popularity. The predictive model demonstrated that Differential Evolution (DE) achieved the highest performance, followed closely by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) also significantly enhancing the baseline ANFIS model. These findings highlight the importance of dataset-driven feature selection and optimization techniques in improving predictive accuracy. This research provides developers with a robust framework for anticipating app success, offering valuable insights in the competitive and rapidly evolving mobile app ecosystem.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Research Progress on Incentive Mechanisms in Mobile Crowdsensing</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the continuous improvement of the sensing, transmission, storage, and computing capabilities of mobile devices, they have become important tools for perceiving the physical environment and social phenomena. Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a data sensing paradigm that utilizes a large number of mobile devices to collect various types of sensing data, ultimately accomplishing large-scale and complex tasks. Effective incentive mechanisms can motivate users to actively participate in data collection tasks and provide high-quality data, making it one of the key issues in MCS. This article reviews the state-of-the-art incentive mechanisms in MCS systems. This article begins with an introduction to the concept of the MCS incentive mechanism, categorizing incentive mechanisms based on different standards. Subsequently, it addresses the primary research issues concerning incentive mechanisms, including data quality, online scenarios, and privacy protection. Then, from the perspective of incentive mechanism technology, it reviews the research progress of incentive mechanisms in recent years, mainly including four types of incentive mechanisms: 1) game theory-based incentive mechanisms; 2) auction theory-based incentive mechanisms; 3) reward allocation-based incentive mechanisms; and 4) learning-based incentive mechanisms, and provides a brief evaluation of each mechanism. Finally, we propose future research directions for MCS incentive mechanisms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Personalized Medicine Recommendation and Disease Flagging Model Based on User’s Previous Orders</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The Recommendation systems gaining importance every passing day and are frequently used in e-commerce websites, content streaming platforms, social media platforms, and other applications to analyze large amounts of data and recommend products or services to users based on their past actions, preferences, and other pertinent factors. This kind of system can effectively be used in healthcare to provide personalized recommendations to patients. In this paper, a recommendation model has been proposed that flags the users with the diseases that they may have based on analyzing their historical medicine order and recommends them with alternate related medicines and products. The proposed model is based on a machine learning technique that takes into consideration the user’s medical history, disease diagnosis, and prescription orders and recommends other related medicine and products. The proposed model uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. A sizable dataset of patient orders from a top pharmaceutical retailer served as the basis for training and validating the model. The simulation results show that the model can handle complex situations, such as multiple medications and medical conditions, and predict medication recommendations with high accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Movie Recommendation System with Sentimental Analysis Using Cosine Similarity Technique</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender systems importance arises in such situations when each online service provider always aims at having many clients. Movie recommendation system is one of the top research areas, currently. It helps the movie enthusiasts by suggesting what movie to watch without going into such a long way to opt from such a large database of movies that is much time consuming and confusing. In this paper, a content-based movie recommendation system is proposed. Along with that, the system is also equipped with sentimental analysis where the sentiments of dynamic users come and helpful for suggesting content-based movies. More importantly, the model is implemented by using the cosine similarity technique, which is highly used in the recommendation systems. Cosine Similarity is such a powerful algorithm that it also has some part use in Netflix. Cosine similarity helps in driving out the ratings of users and aiming to build a powerful recommendation system based upon User based recommender, Item based and Genres recommender. In this model, we proposed the solution of recommending movies with the help of sentiments because movies were previously recommended with the help of user ratings and genres in the content bases system. Although, this model is too eloquent to recommend movies by employing the data of crew members, directors plus main lead top cast actors. Datasets for movie sets are considered from TMDB. However, the movie ratings, genres, release date, runtime and status are scrapped from IMDB. In short, this system is way too good to provide low-rated movie recommendations and predictions according to available datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Analyzing Consumer Attitudes Towards Sustainable Products using SVM and Autoencoders on E-Commerce Platforms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>On a global and national level, there is an effort to encourage more sustainable food consumption. Despite the field's rapid expansion in the past decade, studies examining consumer perspectives and purchasing behaviour are few and far between. One must be knowledgeable about customer beliefs, morality, and preferences in order to adjust to evolving lives and interests. In order to evaluate customer behaviour, a SVM ensemble model incorporates WLPPD for every base classifier. In order to test the model, we use a number of Sustainable Lifestyle Rating datasets. By incorporating novel characteristics and filtering out less-than-ideal hidden-layer outputs during training, HDSSAs improve learning. Compared to existing techniques, the HDSSA model performs better on the Sustainable Lifestyle Rating Dataset. A binary classification F1macro score of 0.91 demonstrates its capacity to detect eco-friendly purchasing habits. Findings demonstrate that state-of-the-art machine learning can increase comprehension of environmentally friendly eating habits. By outlining a thorough framework for studies on consumer sustainable behaviour, this paper improves both theoretical and applied research. Sustainable food marketing, policymaking, and uses of multi-class categorization should be the focus of future research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Injecting Revenue-awareness into Cold-start Recommendation: The Case of Online Insurance</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In online insurance, one of the central challenges is the cold-starting of new insurance products, which means there are no previous samples to refer to. Previous studies have mainly focused on improving the prediction accuracy of new items, but they have failed to consider the revenue generated by existing items. As a result, the total revenue may suffer a loss even if new items get conversions. To address this issue, in this paper we propose RACRec, a Revenue-Aware Cold-start Recommendation framework for online insurance. Unlike previous works, RACRec uses a revenue-based objective function to ensure profitability when cold-starting new items. With this dedicated objective, RACRec orchestrates the cold-start and warm-start model by predicting their expected revenue from each user, thereby preserving the total profit. In order to accurately predict revenue, a double-ranking scheme is designed for the warm-start model to mitigate position bias, while an item embedding alignment algorithm is proposed for the cold-start model to learn the revenue of new items from similar old items. Furthermore, a reinforced orchestrate update scheme is designed to eliminate the impact of sparse conversions and continuously update revenue estimation. Extensive offline and online experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of RACRec.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Time-based Sampling Methods for Detecting Helpful Reviews</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product reviews describe customer opinions and experiences to products. Better opinions and experiences in the reviews more attract and help people who want to buy the products. The reviews, including such factors, are called helpful reviews. Many studies have been conducted to detect helpful reviews and proposed many useful factors, such as review-related factors, product-related factors, and reviewer-related factors. Meanwhile, the elapsed time of reviews has been used as a factor in detecting helpful reviews but never considered as sampling methods, despite that it is an essential factor to determine the freshness of the reviews, which influence the people being interested in the product. In this paper, we propose time-based sampling methods, which determine the sample size as small as possible in detecting helpful reviews with high accuracy. To investigate the effect of the time-based sampling methods in detecting helpful reviews, we conducted extensive experiments comparing with total sampling and simple random sampling, using two machine learning methods: XGBoost and CNN which involve text and numerical factors. Experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed methods. Significantly, in large datasets, our proposed sampling methods outperform the other sampling methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Transfer Learning Strategies for Credit Card Fraud Detection</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Credit card fraud jeopardizes the trust of customers in e-commerce transactions. This led in recent years to major advances in the design of automatic Fraud Detection Systems (FDS) able to detect fraudulent transactions with short reaction time and high precision. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of the fraud behavior makes it difficult to tailor existing systems to different contexts (e.g. new payment systems, different countries and/or population segments). Given the high cost (research, prototype development, and implementation in production) of designing data-driven FDSs, it is crucial for transactional companies to define procedures able to adapt existing pipelines to new challenges. From an AI/machine learning perspective, this is known as the problem of transfer learning. This paper discusses the design and implementation of transfer learning approaches for e-commerce credit card fraud detection and their assessment in a real setting. The case study, based on a six-month dataset (more than 200 million e-commerce transactions) provided by the industrial partner, relates to the transfer of detection models developed for a European country to another country. In particular, we present and discuss 15 transfer learning techniques (ranging from naive baselines to state-of-the-art and new approaches), making a critical and quantitative comparison in terms of precision for different transfer scenarios. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we show that the accuracy of many transfer methods is strongly dependent on the number of labeled samples in the target domain and (ii) we propose an ensemble solution to this problem based on self-supervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation classifiers. The thorough experimental assessment shows that this solution is both highly accurate and hardly sensitive to the number of labeled samples.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>SLA-Driven Trust and Reputation Management Framework for 5G Distributed Service Marketplaces</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The fifth generation (5G) of mobile telecommunications is characterized by massive growth in the number of stakeholders, interconnected devices, and available services distributed under different administrative domains. Distributed marketplaces aim at facilitating stakeholders in the quest and hiring of third party resources and services. Establishing trustworthiness in such an open ecosystem is a cornerstone for the final deployment of these marketplaces in 5G networks and beyond. Hence, building trust management systems that ensure the selection of reliable parties or assets in 5G distributed marketplaces is essential. Thus, a reputation-based trust management framework is proposed to analyze stakeholder behavior patterns and predict trust scores to establish trustworthy relationships across domains. Furthermore, an Service Level Agreement (SLA)-driven reward and punishment mechanism is designed and developed on top of the reputation-based trust framework. Such a mechanism enables continuously adapting trust scores by gathering breach predictions, breach detections, and SLA violations in real time. Furthermore, an edge-based use case is presented to contextualize our reputation-based framework in a tangible enforcement scenario. In conclusion, three experiments were conducted on real-life testbeds demonstrating that our framework fairly distinguishes bad-mouthing attacks with 67% accuracy, when 50% recommenders are corrupted, and is resilient to continuous misbehavior bursts.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Deep Learning-Driven Dynamic Clustering for Intelligent Customer Segmentation</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce businesses acquire considerable competitive edge with successful segmentation of customers, allowing for focused marketing campaigns for particular customer groups. This study suggests a new deep learning-based dynamic clustering method that addresses the shortcomings of traditional clustering techniques in dealing with high-dimensional transaction data. Our approach combines autoencoders for non-linear feature extraction and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for probabilistic clustering in feature space with application to the Online Retail Dataset. Experimental results show significant clustering quality improvement in terms of Silhouette Score (0.392 for GMM in latent space) and Davies-Bouldin Index (0.914 for GMM), while enabling business decision-making with actionable customer insights. Performance measurements show that autoencoders capture non-linear relationships more effectively than PCA, even though they use more computational resources (0.367s vs. 0.025s). Our comparison with K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering identifies competitive advantages and trade-offs, particularly in dealing with intricate, high-dimensional data. The suggested framework adds to customer analytics by providing an efficient, scalable clustering framework that improves segmentation quality and facilitates business growth strategies. This research also emphasizes the capability of deep learning in solving real-world data segmentation problems, laying the groundwork for future optimization studies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>ReStGAN: A step towards visually guided shopper experience via text-to-image synthesis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>E-commerce companies like Amazon, Alibaba and Flip-kart have an extensive catalogue comprising of billions of products. Matching customer search queries to plausible products is challenging due to the size and diversity of the catalogue. These challenges are compounded in apparel due to the semantic complexity and a large variation of fashion styles, product attributes and colours. Providing aids that can help the customer visualise the styles and colours matching their &quot;search queries&quot; will provide customers with necessary intuition about what can be done next. This helps the customer buy a product with the styles, embellishments and colours of their liking. In this work, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images from text streams like customer search queries. Our GAN learns to incrementally generate possible images complementing the fine-grained style, colour of the apparel in the query. We incorporate a novel colour modelling approach enabling the GAN to render a wide spectrum of colours accurately. We compile a dataset from an e-commerce website to train our model. The proposed approach outperforms the baselines on qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Product Market Demand Analysis Using NLP in Banglish Text with Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Product market demand analysis plays a significant role for originating business strategies due to its noticeable impact on the competitive business field. Furthermore, there are roughly 228 million native Bengali speakers, the majority of whom use Banglish text to interact with one another on social media. Consumers are buying and evaluating items on social media with Banglish text as social media emerges as an online marketplace for entrepreneurs. People use social media to find preferred smartphone brands and models by sharing their positive and bad experiences with them. For this reason, our goal is to gather Banglish text data and use sentiment analysis and named entity identification to assess Bangladeshi market demand for smartphones in order to determine the most popular smartphones by gender. We scraped product related data from social media with instant data scrapers and crawled data from Wikipedia and other sites for product information with python web scrapers. Using Python's Pandas and Seaborn libraries, the raw data is filtered using NLP methods. To train our datasets for named entity recognition, we utilized Spacey's custom NER model, Amazon Comprehend Custom NER. A tensorflow sequential model was deployed with parameter tweaking for sentiment analysis. Meanwhile, we used the Google Cloud Translation API to estimate the gender of the reviewers using the BanglaLinga library. In this article, we use natural language processing (NLP) approaches and several machine learning models to identify the most in-demand items and services in the Bangladeshi market. Our model has an accuracy of 87.99% in Spacy Custom Named Entity recognition, 95.51% in Amazon Comprehend Custom NER, and 87.02% in the Sequential model for demand analysis. After Spacy's study, we were able to manage 80% of mistakes related to misspelled words using a mix of Levenshtein distance and ratio algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Crop Recommendation and its Optimal Pricing using ShopBot</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture is one of the biggest economic activities in India. Every year crops are yielded in different regions of the country. This paper proposes a move towards precision agriculture to increase the yield of crops, minimize the cost and automate the inputs for processing. To modernize the process of cultivating crops, data mining techniques for crop recommendation based on the climatic factors primarily rainfall, temperature and location are used. Fertilizers and seeds are mandatory commodities for farming and buying them in large quantities along with proper pricing are necessary. The activity of purchasing a commodity on E-commerce websites with optimal cost and quantity can be monotonous and often one loses out on commodities while browsing. With the increase in online shopping, ShopBot has proven beneficial for online consumer search. A ShopBot offers a minimal search cost as well as compares products from multiple websites. This provides an aspect of optimization in cultivating and purchasing the crop.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Sentiment Analysis and Rating Prediction Using the Review Text Granularity (RTG) Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the era of digital technology, when material created by users is prevalent on online platforms, considerable difficulty is faced in analyzing large volumes of text in order to comprehend user emotions and forecast product ratings. The rapid rise in online reviews and comments necessitates the use of advanced tools to assess this data and extract valuable insights. This is considered crucial for the effectiveness of recommendation systems in many industries. This paper introduces the Review Text Granularity (RTG) Model, a new way to use the complex information in review texts to improve sentiment analysis and rating prediction. The RTG Model uses an advanced approach to scoring sentiments. It measures the strength of sentiments and gives a continuous sentiment score instead of a simple positive or negative label. This makes it different from other binary sentiment analysis methods. Multiple predictive modeling techniques are used, which makes it possible for this comprehensive sentiment analysis to greatly improve the accuracy of rating predictions. It has been shown by research that the depth of textual reviews is better captured and measured by the RTG Model, providing a more detailed and precise picture of user opinions. The RTG Model works really well, making rating predictions in recommendation systems more accurate and useful. A detailed study using a real-world dataset of IMDb movie reviews demonstrated this. The study emphasizes the benefits of utilizing intricate sentiment scores in addition to conventional rating data. The potential applicability of the RTG Model in several fields, including entertainment, e-commerce, and social media, is demonstrated, leading to enhanced and tailored user experiences.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Credit Card is used to make purchases such as AC, groceries, Television, gas, shopping and so on because of non-availability of money at that instance. Credit card have many features like points while using them for different types of transactions. Means of achieving money, services, goods and products by unauthorized means is said to be a fraud. Online fraud is basically the unauthorized use of an individual's personal and confidential information to buy products, services or to remove money from a user's account[1]. With e-commerce and cashless transactions increasing at a fast pace and with the world moving towards digitalization and cashless transactions the use of credit card has increased rapidly over the years and with that the number of frauds associated with credit card are also increasing[2]. The problem of credit card fraud threatens the credit card transactions. Fraud is an intentional deception with purpose of obtaining critical and confidential information for financial gain[3]. In fraud the confidential and private information of the user is disclosed which causes damage to the user. Fraud detection involves identifying fraud transactions among legitimate transactions as quickly as possible.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Study On Sentiment Analysis Combine Matrix Factorization For Ratting Product In Vietnamese</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, hybrid system using different kinds of input data into a unified model become an interesting research. According to it, traditional rating data (user x item) can be re-structured by setting additional dimensions (mood, time, user's location...of textual data). Meanwhile, Vietnamese sentiment analysis problem is also restricted by non-expansion feature of data input. Stem from these issues, this research proposed a featured combine model by integrating matrix factorization in collaborative filtering and sentiment analysis in text mining to predict rating user. With experimental results, the author proves that proposed model achieve better results in accuracy and is feasible to develop as the future direction research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Development of Product Recommendation Engine By Collaborative Filtering and Association Rule Mining Using Machine Learning Algorithms</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommendation engines are a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the ‘rating’ or ‘preference’ that user would give to an item. It finds information designs in the informational index by learning customers decisions and produces the results that co-identifies with their requirements. Real time examples like Amazon, have been using a recommendation engine for suggesting the goods or products that customers might also like. As the database used in this paper consists of large amount of data, it becomes a difficult and cumbersome process to provide viable choice of products for all the customers. The need of state of art recommendation engine is a necessity in real world e-commerce platforms to solve the issue and fulfil the customers’ needs. There are numerous ways such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid filtering, etc. to build a recommendation system. This paper developed a product recommendation engine that uses collaborative filtering approach, which finds similarity between items bought by the customers with other customers, purchase pattern, and association rule mining framework. The recommendations were generated in order to facilitate ‘cross-sell’ across various items. The collaborative filtering (CF) approach produced the top 10 recommendations for each user. The association rule mining produced the rules based on minimum support (at 0.001) and minimum confidence (at 0.8) values. These values produced around 40,000 viable rules. It can be inferred that selection of metrics and the computation speed is important for quality recommendations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Prompt Tuning on Graph-Augmented Low-Resource Text Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Text classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as predicting the topics of online articles and the categories of e-commerce product descriptions. However, low-resource text classification, with no or few labeled samples, presents a serious concern for supervised learning. Meanwhile, many text data are inherently grounded on a network structure, such as a hyperlink/citation network for online articles, and a user-item purchase network for e-commerce products. These graph structures capture rich semantic relationships, which can potentially augment low-resource text classification. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Graph-Grounded Pre-training and Prompting (G2P2) to address low-resource text classification in a two-pronged approach. During pre-training, we propose three graph interaction-based contrastive strategies to jointly pre-train a graph-text model; during downstream classification, we explore handcrafted discrete prompts and continuous prompt tuning for the jointly pre-trained model to achieve zero- and few-shot classification, respectively. Moreover, we explore the possibility of employing continuous prompt tuning for zero-shot inference. Specifically, we aim to generalize continuous prompts to unseen classes while leveraging a set of base classes. To this end, we extend G2P2 into G2P2^**, hinging on a new architecture of conditional prompt tuning. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the strength of G2P2 in zero- and few-shot low-resource text classification tasks, and illustrate the advantage of G2P2^** in dealing with unseen classes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>II-UserCF: Optimizing movie recommendation systems based on UserCF improvement algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the advent of the e-commerce era and the development of computer technology. Recommendation systems are widely used in people's lives. Traditional user-based collaborative filtering recommendations often produce prediction errors because they do not take into account the popularity of the item. In order to improve this drawback, a new collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on a combination of traditional usercf, and item importance is proposed. User relevance is first calculated. Then a new value is obtained based on the different popularity levels of the items. The two are combined in order to obtain a new user similarity. To better predict the similarity between users and to produce more accurate recommendation results. Research shows that adding a value related to the popularity of the product can effectively improve the accuracy of the recommendation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Unsupervised Learning of Domain-Independent User Attributes</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Learning user attributes is essential for providing users with a service. In particular, for e-commerce portals which deal in variety of goods ranging from clothes to foods to home electronics, it is especially important to learn “domain-independent” attributes such as age, gender, and personality that affect people’s behavior across various domains of daily life (e.g., clothing, eating and housing) because these attributes can be used for personalization in diverse domains their service covers. Thus far, researchers have proposed approaches to learn user representation (UR) from user-item interactions, trying to embed rich information about user attributes in UR. However, very few can learn URs that are domain-independent without confounding them with domain-specific attributes (e.g., food preferences). This could consequently undermine the former’s utility for personalizing services in other domains from which the URs are not learned. To address this, we propose an approach to learn URs that exclusively reflect domain-independent attributes. Our approach introduces a novel multi-layer RNN with two types of layers: Domain Specific Layers (DSLs) for modeling behavior in individual domains and a Domain Independent Layer (DIL) for modeling attributes that affect behavior across multiple domains. By exchanging hidden states between these layers, the RNNs implement the process of domain-independent attributes affecting domain-specific behavior and makes the DIL learn URs that capture domain-independence. Our evaluation results confirmed that the URs learned by our approach have greater utility in predicting behavior in the other domains from which these URs were not learned thereby demonstrating adaptability to various domains.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Leveraging RAG With Transformer for Context-Based Personalized Recommendations</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in addressing challenges related to data sparsity and the cold-start problem. In e-commerce, recommendation systems are widely used as strategic tools to boost sales and enhance the customer experience by helping users find relevant products. Custom LLMs, leveraging textual features from user feedback, have been successfully applied to recommendation systems, yielding improvements across various recommendation scenarios. However, most existing methods rely on training-free recommendation approaches, which depend heavily on pre-trained knowledge. When LLMs are trained on sparse data or lack historical information, their performance in recommendation systems can be negatively impacted. Furthermore, inference with LLMs tends to be slow due to autoregressive generation, which limits the efficiency of traditional recommendation methods. To address these challenges, our contributions are: We proposed the Retrieval Augmented Generation with Transformer Recommendation (RAGX11Rec) framework. This framework integrated LLMs with a transformer-based model in a two-step process: 1) RankRAG is used to filter the top-k preferences via tuning the LLM for effective context ranking, 2) a transformer model with 11 embedded layers generated the top-N recommendations based on ranked preferences. Our instruction-tuned transformer module demonstrates superior performance by incorporating a fraction of ranked data into the training process. We evaluated the effectiveness of RAGX11Rec against state-of-the-art baseline methods using two public datasets taken from AliExpress and Epinions. Experimental results indicate that RAGX11Rec consistently outperforms other methods in recommendation accuracy and efficiency. Our key findings are; 1) RAGX11Rec effectively addresses the cold-start problem by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and transformer-based ranking. Unlike traditional models, it can deliver high-quality recommendations even when user interaction data is limited. 2) Tested on public datasets, RAGX11Rec delivered consistent improvements over other models and proved its scalability and adaptability across diverse product categories. This suggests the framework is robust and adaptable enough for large-scale commercial use.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>To Business or Consumer? Competing Choices of Business Models for Online Fresh Stores</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Suppliers who procure fresh products from spot markets and sell them through online fresh stores have become increasingly prevalent. This article develops a game-theoretic model to analyze the strategic choice between the business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) models for two competing suppliers. In the B2B model, each supplier sells to an exclusive retailer through a contingent-pricing contract (CPC), where the contract price is tied to the spot price. In contrast, in the B2C model, suppliers sell directly to consumers but incur direct selling costs. Our analysis reveals that when the correlation between market demand and spot price is relatively weak, both suppliers prefer the B2C model. In contrast, a strong correlation encourages suppliers to choose the B2B model, allowing them to secure higher contract prices and mitigate risks associated with spot price volatility. Furthermore, intensified competition incentivizes the adoption of the B2B model to alleviate competitive pressure, while increased demand uncertainty or spot price volatility may prompt suppliers to adopt the B2C model to eliminate the double marginalization effect. This study provides valuable insights on business model selections under demand uncertainty and spot price volatility, helping suppliers navigate online fresh product markets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Enhancing Customer Relationship Management: Integrating Interpurchase Time with RFM Segmentation for Advanced Customer Insights</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the evolving landscape of customer relationship management (CRM), traditional segmentation models such as reliability, frequency, and monetary (RFM) have been instrumental in tailoring business strategies to diverse customer bases. However, these models often fall short of capturing the dynamic nature of customer behaviors and the temporal aspects of their purchasing patterns. Existing segmentation frameworks lack the ability to incorporate the temporal dynamics between customer purchases, leading to a gap in accurately predicting future customer behaviors and effectively personalizing marketing efforts. This study introduces an enhanced RFMT model that extends the traditional RFM segmentation by incorporating interpurchase time (IPT), providing a more nuanced understanding of customer behavior. By integrating this temporal dimension, our model aims to offer a more comprehensive view of customer engagement and purchase patterns. The enhanced RFMT model was empirically tested and demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional segmentation techniques. Specifically, our model achieved a silhouette score of 0.90, significantly higher than the scores obtained by standard RFM and other benchmark models. The improved RFMT model also got a Davies-Bouldin index of 0.40 and a Calinski-Harabasz index of 12,950, which means it found clear, separate clusters that work better than those made by traditional methods. Our findings suggest that incorporating IPT into customer segmentation practices greatly enhances the ability of businesses to understand and predict customer behaviors, thereby facilitating more targeted and effective CRM strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Towards Expert Systems for Improved Customer Services Using ChatGPT as an Inference Engine</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>By harnessing both implicit and explicit customer data, companies can develop a more comprehensive understanding of their consumers, leading to better customer engagement and experience, and improved loyalty. As a result, businesses have embraced many AI technologies, including chatbots, sentiment analysis, voice assistants, predictive analytics, and natural language processing, within customer services and e-commerce. The arrival of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art deep learning model trained with general knowledge in mind, has brought about a paradigm shift in how companies approach AI applications. However, given that most business problems are bespoke and require specialised domain expertise, ChatGPT needs to be aligned with the requisite task-oriented ability to solve these issues. This paper presents an iterative procedure that incorporates expert system development process models and prompt engineering, in the design of descriptive knowledge and few-shot prompts, as are necessary for ChatGPT-powered expert systems applications within customer services. Furthermore, this paper explores potential application areas for ChatGPT-powered expert systems in customer services, presenting opportunities for their effective utilisation in the business sector.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Cross-Domain Fake Review Detection via Orthogonal Counterfactual Representations</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The popularity of online review-based purchases has led many businesses to generate fake reviews. Manual detection of these fakes is a challenging task. Moreover, existing research focuses primarily on single domain. Further, labelled datasets are limited and restricted to a few domains. Hence, detecting fake reviews in less-explored domains is a significant challenge. Cross-domain fake review detection can be used to handle these challenges by using the knowledge from labeled domains to improve detection in less explored domains. For this, a novel framework, COAT, that trains on Counterfactuals generated by the Orthogonal Alignment of BER T-driven mask infillings for cross-domain fake review detection has been proposed in the paper. Working of the proposed COAT is divided in three phases: 1) two-step masking to remove source-specific cues, 2) counterfactual generation using BERT, followed by orthogonal alignment via Procrustes algorithm, and 3) training and prediction using a Bi-LSTM classifier in a zero-shot setting. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets of Online Products, Hotels, Yelp Restaurants, Doctors and Restaurant reviews, divided in two groups. Obtained results show that the proposed COAT framework exhibits an enhanced domain transfer with a significant improvement in average accuracy by 17.31% and 26.18%, as well as F1-score by 19.05% and 51.16% on the two groups, respectively, over its counterparts in consideration. This shows that COAT empowers businesses, online platforms, and consumers with more reliable insights and fosters informed decision-making and trust in e-commerce platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>FLAIR: Federated Learning for Augmented Industrial Retrieval</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Deep learning (DL) has significantly advanced Industry 4.0 by leveraging data from the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to enable smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance, and data-driven product marketing. However, multimodal industrial data presents challenges for traditional frameworks, including scalability, data privacy, and integration efficiency. This article introduces an efficient product retrieval framework for e-commerce systems, addressing privacy and performance challenges through federated learning (FL). Specifically, we propose FL for augmented industrial retrieval (FLAIR), a novel part retrieval system where distributed warehouses collaboratively train a multimodal foundation model, contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP), by fine-tuning only the Adapter module via FL, ensuring data privacy and efficiency. To address the limited availability of multimodal industrial data, our framework incorporates effective data augmentation strategies to enhance the diversity and quality of the training dataset. Comprehensive experiments on the industrial language-image dataset (ILID) highlight that FLAIR holds effective privacy safeguards and strong retrieval capabilities. Additionally, an advanced e-commerce recommendation system built on FLAIR showcases its practical effectiveness. FLAIR represents the first application of FL for industrial product retrieval, optimizing part searches, inventory management, and customer experience while maintaining data security.

        <dc:title>A Study on SME Traditional Food Product Feedback by Leveraging Word2vec</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The impact of reviews on sellers can be seen in improving services, products and communication. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) sadly lack the ability to properly manage review data on social media channels, which might provide insightful analysis of the things they sell. This study focuses on examining the review associated with traditional food in e-commerce and find the accuracy of Skip-Gram and Continous Bag of Words (CBOW). The review will use word2vec as a word embedding. Word2vec will predicts words based on Skip-Gram and CBOW. For modeling data the experiment use random forest and support vector machine and evaluated by confusion matrix. The result presents that Continuous Bag of Words surpasses the accuracy of skip-gram in two conditions splitting data which is 83,5% for 9 training: 1 testing and 85,5 for 7 training: 3 testing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Hybrid Genetic Algorithms for Order Assignment and Batching in Picking System: A Systematic Literature Review</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The Order-Picking System (OPS) is vital for inbound logistics, ensuring efficient customer order fulfillment and minimizing costs. Efficient execution and implementation of OPS are critical to meeting customer demands and reducing dissatisfaction, necessitating a thorough examination of the process of order picking features. The order picking, a cornerstone of warehouse operations, involves meticulous selection and gathering of items from designated storage locations, unfolding through stages like order assignment and order batching. In order assignment, specific orders are methodically delegated to pickers or teams, considering factors like urgency, order size, item location, and picker availability. The overarching goal is to optimize resource utilization and simultaneously reduce the time needed for order fulfillment, ensuring a streamlined and efficient approach. Conversely, order batching strategically groups multiple orders for concurrent picking, aiming to minimize trips and enhance overall efficiency and productivity. Throughout the order-picking process, pickers utilize tools like pick lists, barcode scanners, and automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) for precise item location and retrieval. Post-collection, items are transported to a dedicated packing area for meticulous preparations before shipping to the customer. Orchestrating the order-picking process requires careful planning, coordination, and execution for punctual and precise customer order fulfillment. This paper highlighted a systematic reviewing process which analyzed relevant research papers, with a primary focus on the problems of order assignment and batching—a key area within the order-picking process. The objective was to provide a comprehensive overview of hybrid Genetic Algorithm solutions for these challenges, achieved through a systematic review from 2018 to 2023 using Web of Science and Scopus databases. After screening, the relevant references were selected, focusing on terms like storage assignment problems. A thorough examination delved into various subcategories, encompassing recent approaches of genetic algorithms and openly accessible datasets. The resulting review offers a concise summary, highlighting key findings, challenges, and potential directions associated with hybrid genetic algorithms, specifically in relation to storage assignment, storage location assignment problems, and order batching issues.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Designing enhancements for App-based cab services to the commuters during COVID-19 era: a new normal solution on Indian scenario</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>In the COVID-19-impacted world, life has almost come to a standstill. The primary reason is the social distancing constraints that have been imposed on cab bookings, local shops, and restaurants. Here, the authors provide a possible solution through a mobile application to integrate multiple features required by people to make themselves comfortable in these “new normal” conditions. The application provides the perfect solution for organizations like the Airport Authority of India or any similar organization to resume their business and thrive in this period. All the said facilities are separately provided by many companies that earn a huge profit, while the Airport Authority does not see profits. To trade-off all these things, the authors have deployed a solution that can give all the required support required by the commuters while travelling via airplane; at the same time, the Airport Authority also gets due profits by providing facilities to the commuters while maintaining social distancing amidst COVID-19 risk prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>SecureSwipe Enhancing Card Transactions Through Gradient Boosted Fraud Detection</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Credit cards have emerged as a dominant mode of payment, both in traditional physical establishments and the realm of online transactions, thanks to advancements in electronic commerce systems and communication technology. However, this surge in popularity has also given rise to an increase in fraudulent activities associated with credit card transactions. Businesses and individuals face significant financial losses each year due to fraudulent credit card transactions, as criminals continuously devise new methods to exploit vulnerabilities. Researchers encounter substantial challenges in identifying credit card theft, as fraudsters exhibit quick thinking and resourcefulness. The datasets provided for credit card fraud detection pose an additional obstacle, being severely unbalanced and complicating the development of effective detection systems. Responsible and secure credit card usage offers numerous benefits, but engaging in fraudulent behaviour can have detrimental effects on one’s credit and financial well-being. Addressing the escalating issue of credit card theft has prompted the proposal of several solutions. The widespread adoption of electronic payments has heightened the importance of efficient and effective methods for identifying fraudulent transactions. In this study, a machine learning approach, specifically the Gradient Boosting Classifier, is recommended as an intelligent means of detecting fraud in credit card transactions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendation System for Movies Using Improved version of SOM with Hybrid Filtering Methods</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Many industries uses recommendation systems (RS) to iden-tify product recommendations when users actively participate on e-commerce sites. Recently, massive growth in both goods and consumers has faced serious challenges. Numerous websites present the consumer with numerous options at once, creating a lot of confusion. In addition, finding the right product or active user is an essential part of RS. Products are already recommended based on consumer preferences and sociodemo-graphic trends. A hybrid-action-related recommendation based on K-Nearest Neighbor Similarity (HAR-KNN) combines the ease of hybrid filtering with the development of feature vectors to improve the user behaviour matrix. To categorize attributes, it uses both quality and quantity classifiers. Additionally, the proposed methodology overcomes shortcomings in earlier approaches to evaluating user preference for goods and feature analysis. The SOM AND KNN classification technique has been approved for the purpose of locating information about user behavior online and in real time for a specific user group containing a large amount of data in re-lation to the commonalities among many users and target users. A test result is evaluated by using highly predictive metrics such as Precision (P), Recall (R), F, as well as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).INDEX TERMS Recommendation System (RS), User behaviour data, Hy-brid filtering, KNN, behavioural matrix.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Forecast of Consumer Behaviour using the Naivesbayes Algorithm</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting customer behavior is essential for developing an effective e-commerce strategy so that companies can offer personal and targeted marketing based on likely purchase trends. This paper proposes a model based on the Naive Bayes classifier to predict purchases based on customer purchase behavior defined by the following attributes: age, gender, predicted salary, and purchase history. The Naive Bayes algorithm has been selected due to its simplicity and efficiency to handle the task of multifeature classification. The data preprocessing included categorical encoding and normalization of the continuous ones. Then, this dataset was divided into a training and testing subset. For this model, prediction about the likelihood to buy had already reached an accuracy of 81% More metrics used for evaluation were precision, recall, the F1-score: all gave a thumbs up at its capability to handle class imbalance appropriately. The study findings indicated that income and age were the two major factors that influenced a customer's purchasing behavior, though the higher-income customers and greater age groups tend to make more purchases. These research findings thus prove that the Naive Bayes classifier has practical value in real-life ecommerce applications for the tasks of customer segmentation, thereby supporting developments in more sophisticated marketing strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Study and Comparision of Vectorization Techniques Used in Text Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Reviews on products and movies play an important role in predicting and formulating business strategies. Entertainment media, E-commerce, and social media use customers’ reviews to analyze customers’ requirements and level of satisfaction with the product. Business Analyst uses Sentiment Analysis for analyzing the attitude of the users from their reviews. E-commerce websites, entertainment and social media posts, tweets, comments, reviews, status, etc are the major sources of sentiment data (reviews). In the review system, users give the rating on a predefined scale of (1-5) i.e lowest to highest in terms of their satisfaction. As sentiment Analysis is one of the major applications of Machine Learning and machine learning deals with numeric data, so, textual-based review data needs to be converted into numeric data. Conversion of text to numeric form requires a large amount of memory and it is time-consuming also. This paper presents various vectorization techniques and their comparison in terms of memory management to convert text file into a vector file. The comparison shows gensim library-based Doc2Vec approach reduces memory requirements by up to 80%. This will also reduce the time consumption for task analysis and data processing of the model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Recommendation Systems: Content-Based Filtering vs Collaborative Filtering</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A job seeker will spend hours searching for the most useful information while dealing with the vast volume of recruiting information available on the Internet. In today's technologically evolved world, the majority of internet users are continuously searching for various goods on the internet, and we normally do it via search engines. When searching, it's important to get the most relevant results possible, which recommender systems can help with. Users can easily find and evaluate items of interest when confronted with a huge number of possibilities. The goal of recommender systems is to establish a connection between products and consumers based on the users' interests. We evaluate and contrast the two basic approaches to recommendation systems in this paper. The first is referred to as Collaborative Filtering, and the second is referred to as Content-based Filtering.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Adaptive Pre-Training and Collaborative Fine-Tuning: A Win-Win Strategy to Improve Review Analysis Tasks</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summarizing user reviews and classifying user sentiment are two critical tasks for modern e-commerce platforms. These two tasks can benefit each other by capturing the shared linguistic features. However, such a relationship has not been fully exploited by existing research on domain-specific contextual representations. This work explores a win-win strategy for a multi-task framework with three stages: general pre-training, adaptive pre-training, and collaborative fine-tuning. The task-adaptive continual pre-training on a language model can obtain domain-specific contextual representations, further used to improve two related tasks, sentiment classification and review summarization during the collaborative fine-tuning. Meanwhile, to effectively capture sentiment-oriented domain-specific contextual representations, we introduce a novel task-adaptive pre-training procedure, which adds a sentiment prediction task during the adaptive pre-training. Extensive experiments conducted on two adaption scenarios of a general-to-single domain and a general-to-multiple domain show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Optimizing Power Beacon Deployment in Battery-Less Wireless Sensor Networks for Transforming E-Commerce</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless sensor networks (WSN) in E-commerce enhances supply chain visibility and ensures product quality through real-time tracking, revolutionizing inventory management system. IoT devices (IoTDs) gather extensive consumer data, enriching E-commerce databases. Using advanced analytics and machine learning, platforms create personalized recommendations, targeted ads, and customized promotions, enhancing customer engagement and loyalty. While IoT and WSN devices provide valuable insights for E-commerce applications, it’s imperative to address their energy limitations to uphold quality of service. This article explores battery-less IoTDs powered by wireless Power Beacons (PBs). To address this challenge, we employed both omni-directional PBs and directional PBs for powering IoTDs. We have proposed a novel scheme for the optimal number of power beacons (ONPB) which is based on set cover problem. The Omni Directional Cliques (ODC) and Directional Cliques (DC) algorithms are employed to cover the IoTDs, followed by the optimization of PBs placement using the ONPB algorithm, leveraging both omni and directional PBs features.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Creating a Forensic Database of Shoeprints from Online Shoe-Tread Photos</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Shoe-tread impressions are one of the most common types of evidence left at crime scenes. However, the utility of such evidence is limited by the lack of databases of footwear prints that cover the large and growing number of distinct shoe models. Moreover, the database is preferred to contain the 3D shape, or depth, of shoe-tread photos so as to allow for extracting shoeprints to match a query (crime-scene) print. We propose to address this gap by leveraging shoe-tread photos collected by online retailers. The core challenge is to predict depth maps for these photos. As they do not have ground-truth 3D shapes allowing for training depth predictors, we exploit synthetic data that does. We develop a method, termed ShoeRinsics, that learns to predict depth from fully supervised synthetic data and unsupervised retail image data. In particular, we find domain adaptation and intrinsic image decomposition techniques effectively mitigate the synthetic-real domain gap and yield significantly better depth predictions. To validate our method, we introduce 2 validation sets consisting of shoe-tread image and print pairs and define a benchmarking protocol to quantify the quality of predicted depth. On this benchmark, ShoeRinsics outperforms existing methods of depth prediction and synthetic-to-real domain adaptation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This work presents an intelligent autonomic computing framework that is supposed to strengthen selfoptimization by means of autonomous learning. The purpose is to endow mechanical systems with the capability of adaptively responding by automating resources, tuning their operation, and adapting to environmental conditions with little human intervention. Through the borrowing of control theory, predictive analytics, and machine learning, the model provides timely informed decision-making that is in real-time. The framework presents a dynamic resource allocation scheme which is compared against performance indicators such as Resource Efficiency, Training Cycle Length, and Predictive Accuracy. Enhanced performance in terms of system efficiency and responsiveness was noted proclaiming the possibility of advantages towards industrial automation smart factories and cyber-physical systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Hybrid Filter-Wrapper Approach for Feature Selection in Deceptive Consumer Review Classification</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, due to the prevailing situation of the world, people are heavily focusing on online transactions. There has been a rapid increase in online transactions and several types of data generated through such transactions during the last few years. As there is no other involvement in purchasing decisions, customers make purchasing judgments through the reviews. Therefore, not only for making purchasing decisions but also customer reviews provide valuable information regarding the products for decision-makers. By considering this as an advantage, fraudulent reviewers tend to write reviews to promote or downgrade products. Deceptive reviews can be identified via reviewer behavioural features, content-related features, or review features. But all the extracted features may not be critical for identifying deceptive. This research introduces a novel filter-wrapper hybrid approach to select optimal features to identify deceptive online customer reviews. A combination of univariate and multivariate filter methods as well as a wrapper method with the bidirectional search were used to select the features. The model was evaluated using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. The proposed hybrid approach shows the highest model accuracy against the sole traditional approaches. The selected optimal features used for model building are effective as they reveal the most statistically significant features when predicting the deceptive reviews..</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Holistic Roadmap of Trends in Radio Access Network Slicing: A Survey</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Over the years, radio access network (RAN) slicing has been perceived to facilitate resource sharing in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. Resource allocation particularly deals with efficiently subleasing and assigning resources to satisfy the demand of customers. Resource trading, on the other hand, creates a lucrative marketplace for exchanging scarce radio resources for remuneration by designing innovative incentive mechanisms for profit maximization. The constant expansion in network capacity has reiterated the need for groundbreaking approaches to achieve sustainability while increasing profits and resource utilization efficiency. However, the existing RAN slicing paradigm is faced with several challenges involved with security issues in the open network environment. This article provides an overview of the trends in RAN slicing research with a focus on its technical, trading, and security aspects. Specifically, several algorithms proposed in RAN slicing research to solve the allocation, trading, and security issues are discussed. Then we present various critical challenges existing in resource sharing, as well as new research directions that may uncover novel techniques in the 5G and beyond paradigms. With this survey, we provide a blueprint to guide future research in RAN slicing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>An Item-based Collaborative Filtering Approach for Movie Recommendation System</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Data has exploded in the last ten years because of social media, electronic commerce, and the general digitization of enterprises. The data is used for leading decisions, predict the market trends, and detect patterns in customer preferences. Since internet services have been made available to the general public, recommendation systems have proliferated. The goal is to employ filtering and clustering algorithms to propose content to visitors that they may find interesting. Information filtering systems called recommender systems anticipate user bias or rating for a specific item. Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods are the most favored among many suggested filtering methods due to their popularity. Even for complex issues, they can generate standardized advice. Collaborative filtering methods produce superior suggestions for products depending on their neighbors' tastes. Contrastingly, other approaches like content-based, have difficulty with accuracy, data sparsity, scalability, and big-error forecasting. In this study, we propose an item-based CF method where we initially analyze the user's item rating pattern and then we establish the connections between several items. The recommendations for the user are then computed using these associations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>PICASSO: Unleashing the Potential of GPU-centric Training for Wide-and-deep Recommender Systems</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The development of personalized recommendation has significantly improved the accuracy of information matching and the revenue of e-commerce platforms. Recently, it has two trends: 1) recommender systems must be trained timely to cope with ever-growing new products and ever-changing user interests from online marketing and social network; 2) state-of-the-art recommendation models introduce deep neural network (DNN) modules to improve prediction accuracy. Traditional CPU-based recommender systems cannot meet these two trends, and GPU-centric training has become a trending approach. However, we observe that GPU devices in training recommender systems are underutilized, and they cannot attain an expected throughput improvement as what it has achieved in Computer Vision (CV) and Neural Language Processing (NLP) areas. This issue can be explained by two characteristics of these recommendation models: First, they contain up to a thousand of input feature fields, introducing fragmentary and memory-intensive operations; Second, the multiple constituent feature interaction submodules introduce substantial small-sized compute kernels. To remove this roadblock to the development of recommender systems, we propose a novel framework named PICASSO to accelerate the training of recommendation models on commodity hardware. Specifically, we conduct a systematic analysis to reveal the bottlenecks encountered in training recommendation models. We leverage the model structure and data distribution to unleash the potential of hardware through our packing, interleaving, and caching optimization. Experiments show that PICASSO increases the hardware utilization by an order of magnitude on the basis of state-of-the-art baselines and brings up to 6× throughput improvement for a variety of industrial recommendation models. Using the same hardware budget in production, PICASSO on average shortens the walltime of daily training tasks by 7 hours, significantly reducing the delay of continuous delivery.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A Review of Neuromarketing Techniques and Emotion Analysis Classifiers for Visual-Emotion Mining</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>“People do well to express what they want, what they like, or how much they will pay for something. But they do not really know where that value comes from, or how and when it is influenced by such things as store demonstrations or products.” With the growing trend of studying consumer behavior, a study called neuro-marketing can be applied on previous findings related to neuroscience to get an idea of marketing strategies. To obtain feedback about a product from various e-commerce sites sentiment and opinion mining of neurons can be carried out. This helps a user to predict emotions, to extract opinions from the internet and predict customer's preferences by applying various neuromarketing techniques. The paper provides a review of various neuromarketing and emotion analysis techniques to study marketing behavior.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Arabic Sentiment Analysis with Social Network Data: A Comparative Study</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Social media platforms have become essential in modern society, with usage rapidly increasing. These platforms serve various roles, from entertainment and personal expression to education and e-commerce. Users frequently share opinions, generating valuable but largely unstructured data. Businesses and governments utilize sentiment analysis on this data to understand public opinions and predict behaviors, aiding in the improvement of products, services, and policies. However, the unstructured na-ture of the data makes its analysis complex. This article provide a comprehensive evaluation of several machine learning (ML) mod-els, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR) on Twitter data for Arabic sentiment classification. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into the preprocessing steps required to prepare the data for analysis. It also discusses the selection of effective feature extraction techniques for Saudi dialect and modern Arabic sentiment analysis to gauge their efficacy in analyzing social media data. Among various feature extraction methods, TF-IDF consistently demonstrated superior accuracy, with SVM emerging as the top-performing model at 92.4%. Finally, a public dataset focusing on customer sentiment towards Saudi banks is employed to further validate our findings and their generalizability across different domains such as government policies and commercial sectors.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>New Solutions To Combat Counterfeits</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Prolonged lead times with tier 1 component suppliers during COVID had many OEMs stuck with 100,0001 vehicles and electronic systems unable to ship because they didn't have necessary components. Often integrated circuit (IC) components under 10 were the reason for holding up large shipments. This situation forced OEMs and Contract Manufacturers to go through component resellers (brokers) as it was often the fastest way to get the needed parts. Those in the component manufacturing industry had insider information in forecasted demand, manufacturing lead times, end customers, and component price in reseller market. Resellers of components during COVID found early on that OEMs would pay 8x more on components months after stock dried up to build those 100,000 vehicles and electronic systems. China, for example, is the world's largest electronics component manufacturer and any of the 4.7 million people in the industry with insider information could participate in the arbitrage. For over a year, there was abundant opportunity for millions of people to make 800% on investments in less than a year. And many did. As components became scarcer and more expensive from the reseller market, OEMs began designing certain components out of their products. One product after another eliminated the need for components that are in reseller inventory. Without customers, resellers would recoup sunk costs by trading their non-selling inventory to other resellers. Many IC chip components have the same plastic body housing. Black topping or sanding, laser marking, and repackaging turns unsalable inventory into a gold mine. Counterfeiters knew that most customers won't test or inspect IC chips because it is time consuming and difficult. Remarking puts those parts back in the supply chain. Inventory purchased during COVID-19 will undoubtedly enter the global supply chain under different part numbers. These imposter components pose significant risk to critical electronics for many years to come. Just one counterfeit component leads to field failures which results in loss of life, engineers losing their jobs, company reputation damaged, and expensive lawsuits. Over the next five years, the global electronics manufacturing services industry will grow by 300 billion2, bringing the total global value to $856 billion. This is due to increased demand for self-driving cars, medical devices for aging population, space exploration, and defense spending. Competitive pressure will push these industries to have more feature -packed and smaller products. More demand for more integrated circuit chips doing more things in critical electronics3. The last few years startups have approached the problem of counterfeit components. There are different approaches to address this problem. Going to highlight the novel approaches by two innovative startups leading the industry.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>MDE-Based Approach for Accelerating the Development of Recommender Systems in Smart Tourism</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender systems (RSs) have become fundamental computational tools deployed across diverse domains, including e-commerce, tourism, and streaming platforms to facilitate personalized content delivery through the analysis of user preferences, behavioral patterns, and interaction data. With the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, these RSs can be implemented either through established frameworks such as NReco and Apache Mahout, or through custom development. Despite the availability of multiple implementation approaches, RS development remains computationally complex, necessitating substantial expertise in both software engineering principles and artificial intelligence methodologies. To address these technical challenges, this paper presents a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) framework that streamlines and accelerates RS development for smart tourism applications through a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) methodology. The proposed framework minimizes the requirement for extensive programming or ML expertise and enables developers to efficiently generate customized RS implementations while maintaining system quality. The DSL framework automates the generation of code that leverages the services provided by the Apache Mahout framework for implementing recommendation algorithms, abstracting the underlying complexity and enabling developers to focus on high-level system design rather than the technical details of algorithm implementation. In addition, the framework integrates a code generator and a modeling tool, allowing developers to design and implement recommendation systems with reduced complexity and enhanced productivity. Unlike generic or low-code platforms, this approach combines domain-specific abstractions with automation tools to address the unique challenges of the smart tourism sector, ensuring adaptability, efficiency, and high-quality results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>ITSMatch: Improved Safe Semi-Supervised Text Classification Under Class Distribution Mismatch</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) brings deep learning from lab with expensive label data costs to real-world commercial application. Today, deep SSL is being universally applied in various artificial intelligence commercial technologies. However, there may be a distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled datasets in practical application, which is a key issue that degrades deep SSL performance. Some recent studies deal with out-of-distribution (OOD) data by directly removing or uniformly reducing weights, which ignore potential value of OOD data. To address the issue, we propose ITSMatch, a simple, safe and effective SSL method to process text classification by recycling OOD data near labeled domain to fully utilize data information. Specifically, a weighted adversarial domain adaptation is applied to OOD data to project it into the space of labeled and in-distribution (ID) data, and its recover ability is accurately quantified by the transferable score. ITSMatch unifies mainstream methods, including pseudo-labels generation and consistency regularization on unlabeled data and its augmented data. Besides, we also perform metric learning on labeled data and ID data with pseudo-labels to fully acquire sample space features. Experiment results on the AG News and Yelp datasets demonstrate that our ITSMatch method performs better than the baseline methods including TextSMatch, MixText, UDA, and BERT. This method of semi-supervised text classification can be applied to the analysis of product reviews on e-commerce platforms to improve customers’ online shopping experience.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>SkillVet: Automated Traceability Analysis of Amazon Alexa Skills</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Skills, are essential components in Smart Personal Assistants (SPA). The number of skills has grown rapidly, dominated by a changing environment that has no clear business model. Skills can access personal information and this may pose a risk to users. However, there is little information about how this ecosystem works, let alone the tools that can facilitate its study. In this article, we present the largest systematic measurement of the Amazon Alexa skill ecosystem to date. We study developers’ practices in this ecosystem, including how they collect and justify the need for sensitive information, by designing a methodology to identify over-privileged skills with broken privacy policies. We collect 199,295 Alexa skills and uncover that around 43% of the skills (and 50% of the developers) that request these permissions follow bad privacy practices, including (partially) broken data permissions traceability. In order to perform this kind of analysis at scale, we present SkillVet that leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques, and generates high-accuracy prediction sets. We report several concerning practices, including how developers can bypass Alexa's permission system through account linking and conversational skills, and offer recommendations on how to improve transparency, privacy and security. Resulting from the responsible disclosure we did, 13% of the reported issues no longer pose a threat at submission time.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Smart Environment Monitoring Models Using Cloud‐Based Data Analytics: A Comprehensive Study</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summary The idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged in recent years and is growing rapidly. The main aim is to connect real‐world things over the cloud to the Internet. The various real‐time applications such as farming, weather forecasting uses rain, temperature, moisture, and loam sensors which are connected to an Internet. Thus, various kinds of information such as temperature, moisture, humidity, and rain can be processed later by using data analytics method to identify these and make effective decisions and approaches for monitoring smart environment. Similarly, traders of online shopping uses online data collected through various online shopping clouds through servers to analyze which product is to be more in demand, etc. The reflective transformation in economical system shall be possible in coming years through cloud‐based data analytics which can be said as reliable, sustainable, and robust system. The transformation of modernization can only be achieved with persistent usage of information technologies and communication technologies to manage as well as integrate this complete system. Therefore, by providing parallel processing of data and distributed data storage, cloud computing has been envisaged as an emerging technology of making possible this integration. Due to rapid up‐gradations in IoT, the Industry 4.0 grows and to handle the issues of large amount of data storage and its processing, cloud came up with variations of data storage and management strategies. Along with support of combination of cloud and IoT, the working styles in many fields become easier. The various challenges and issues have discussed in this chapter. The communication technologies that vary according to the application requirements have been depicted in this chapter. The today's working scenario and life style have been conquered by combination of IoT and cloud. It has been reached to every little part of the human life right from the monitoring of health, farming, smart industries, smart home, metering, video surveillance, etc. This chapter is designed for readers who intend to begin cloud‐based data analytics research with detailed knowledge and compile challenges, issues, organize, research avenues, and summarize using cloud. This chapter discusses the overview of the potential applications of cloud computing in smart working systems and case studies. It also describes the main technologies and innovations that will support the smart environment. The organization of the chapter is followed by subsections including introduction, challenges and issues, data models and applications, etc.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Mitigating Cold Start Problem in Recommendation Systems via Transfer Learning Approach</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Recommender system provides personalized services to its customers from a huge amount of choices available to them in different domains i.e. E-commerce, Music streaming apps, E- Learning platforms. Understanding the preferences of new users is a challenging task in recommendation systems, commonly known as Cold Start problem, since no prior knowledge about the users interests is provided. In such scenarios, data from social networking sites could be utilized to determine user preferences. In this work, we have proposed a novel Dove Regression based Recommendation System (DRbRS) which employs a Transfer learning approach that utilizes user interactions from social media sites and applies learnt information to suggest pertinent products to new users. The user profile is built using information directly provided by the user and predictions are made based on this classification using machine learning methods like classification trees. The results and comparative analysis of the proposed model indicate better performance and various performance measurements, including accuracy, precision, Recall, and F1-score were evaluated.</dcterms:abstract>
